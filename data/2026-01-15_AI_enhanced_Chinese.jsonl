Generative AI is emerging as a powerful engine for such transitions. However, we show that Generative AI-driven developments pose a critical pitfall: fairness concerns. In robotic applications, although intuitions about fairness are common, a precise and implementable definition that captures user utility and inherent data randomness is missing. Here we provide a utility-aware fairness metric for robotic decision making and analyze fairness jointly with user-data privacy, deriving conditions under which privacy budgets govern fairness metrics. This yields a unified framework that formalizes and quantifies fairness and its interplay with privacy, which is tested in a robot navigation task. In view of the fact that under legal requirements, most robotic systems will enforce user privacy, the approach shows surprisingly that such privacy budgets can be jointly used to meet fairness targets. Addressing fairness concerns in the creative combined consideration of privacy is a step towards ethical use of AI and strengthens trust in autonomous robots deployed in everyday environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u9762\u5411\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u6548\u7528\u611f\u77e5\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u8054\u5408\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9690\u79c1\u9884\u7b97\u53ef\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u51b3\u7b56\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u9690\u60a3\uff0c\u800c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u65e2\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u7528\u6237\u6548\u7528\u53c8\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u6570\u636e\u968f\u673a\u6027\u7684\u53ef\u5b9e\u65bd\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5b9a\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6548\u7528\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u51b3\u7b56\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u8054\u5408\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u9690\u79c1\u9884\u7b97\u5982\u4f55\u63a7\u5236\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9690\u79c1\u9884\u7b97\u53ef\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u7528\u4e8e\u6ee1\u8db3\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u6cd5\u5f8b\u8981\u6c42\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u9020\u6027\u7ed3\u5408\u9690\u79c1\u8003\u8651\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u662f\u8fc8\u5411AI\u4f26\u7406\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u4e00\u6b65\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u65e5\u5e38\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Most existing soft grippers are pneumatically actuated with several hundred kPa pressure, and cannot generate output force sufficient for such a large and heavy object. Instead of pneumatic actuation, hydraulic actuation has a potential to generate much larger power by several MPa pressure. In this study, we develop a hydraulically-driven soft gripper, in which its basic design parameters are determined based on a mathematical model that represents the relationship among the driving pressure, bending angle, object mass and grasping force. Moreover, we selected materials suitable for grasping a heavier object, based on the finite element analysis result of the detailed design. We report experimental results on a 20 kg object grasping and closed-loop control of the finger bending angle.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u6db2\u538b\u9a71\u52a8\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6293\u624b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6293\u53d610-20\u516c\u65a4\u91cd\u7269\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6c14\u52a8\u65b9\u6848\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u5927\u6293\u53d6\u529b", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6c14\u52a8\u8f6f\u4f53\u6293\u624b\u538b\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff08\u51e0\u767ekPa\uff09\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6293\u53d610-20\u516c\u65a4\u91cd\u7269\uff0c\u6db2\u538b\u9a71\u52a8\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u6570MPa\u538b\u529b\uff0c\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u5927\u529f\u7387", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u786e\u5b9a\u57fa\u672c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u9a71\u52a8\u538b\u529b\u3001\u5f2f\u66f2\u89d2\u5ea6\u3001\u7269\u4f53\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6293\u53d6\u529b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u9650\u5143\u5206\u6790\u9009\u62e9\u9002\u5408\u6293\u53d6\u91cd\u7269\u7684\u6750\u6599\uff1b\u5b9e\u73b0\u624b\u6307\u5f2f\u66f2\u89d2\u5ea6\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u63a7\u5236", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5f00\u53d1\u51fa\u6db2\u538b\u9a71\u52a8\u8f6f\u4f53\u6293\u624b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf920\u516c\u65a4\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u6293\u53d6\u5b9e\u9a8c", "conclusion": "\u6db2\u538b\u9a71\u52a8\u8f6f\u4f53\u6293\u624b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6293\u53d6\u5927\u578b\u91cd\u7269\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cd\u578b\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848"}}

To address this limitation, we propose Cross-Embodiment Interface (\\CEI), a framework for cross-embodiment learning that enables the transfer of demonstrations across different robot arm and end-effector morphologies. \\CEI introduces the concept of \\textit{functional similarity}, which is quantified using Directional Chamfer Distance. Then it aligns robot trajectories through gradient-based optimization, followed by synthesizing observations and actions for unseen robot arms and end-effectors. In experiments, \\CEI transfers data and policies from a Franka Panda robot to \\textbf{16} different embodiments across \\textbf{3} tasks in simulation, and supports bidirectional transfer between a UR5+AG95 gripper robot and a UR5+Xhand robot across \\textbf{6} real-world tasks, achieving an average transfer ratio of 82.4\\%. Finally, we demonstrate that \\CEI can also be extended with spatial generalization and multimodal motion generation capabilities using our proposed techniques.

Format Decoupled Reinforcement Learning for Document OCR", "comment": "technical report", "summary": "Reading text from images or scanned documents via OCR models has been a longstanding focus of researchers. Intuitively, text reading is perceived as a straightforward perceptual task, and existing work primarily focuses on constructing enriched data engineering to enhance SFT capabilities. In this work, we observe that even advanced OCR models exhibit significantly higher entropy in formatted text (\\emph{e.g.}, formula, table, etc.) compared to plain text, often by an order of magnitude. These statistical patterns reveal that advanced OCR models struggle with high output uncertainty when dealing with format sensitive document, suggesting that reasoning over diverse reading pathways may improve OCR performance. To address this, we propose format decoupled reinforcement learning (FD-RL), which leverages high-entropy patterns for targeted optimization. Our approach employs entropy-based data filtration strategy to identify format-intensive instances, and adopt format decoupled rewards tailored to different format types, enabling format-level validation rather than token-level memorization. FD-RL achieves an average score of 90.41 on OmniDocBench, setting a new record for end-to-end models on this highly popular benchmark. More importantly, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies over data, training, filtering, and rewarding strategies, thoroughly validating their effectiveness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u683c\u5f0f\u89e3\u8026\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60(FD-RL)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u71b5\u6a21\u5f0f\u8bc6\u522b\u683c\u5f0f\u654f\u611f\u6587\u6863\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u683c\u5f0f\u89e3\u8026\u5956\u52b1\u4f18\u5316OCR\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728OmniDocBench\u4e0a\u521b\u4e0b90.41\u5206\u65b0\u8bb0\u5f55", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709OCR\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u683c\u5f0f\u654f\u611f\u6587\u6863\uff08\u5982\u516c\u5f0f\u3001\u8868\u683c\uff09\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff08\u71b5\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u4ec5\u9760\u4e30\u5bcc\u6570\u636e\u5de5\u7a0b\u589e\u5f3aSFT\u80fd\u529b\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63a8\u7406\u591a\u79cd\u9605\u8bfb\u8def\u5f84\u6765\u63d0\u5347OCR\u6027\u80fd", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u683c\u5f0f\u89e3\u8026\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60(FD-RL)\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8fc7\u6ee4\u7b56\u7565\u8bc6\u522b\u683c\u5f0f\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff1b2\uff09\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u683c\u5f0f\u7c7b\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u683c\u5f0f\u89e3\u8026\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u683c\u5f0f\u7ea7\u9a8c\u8bc1\u800c\u975e\u8bcd\u5143\u7ea7\u8bb0\u5fc6", "result": "\u5728OmniDocBench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f9790.41\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u5206\uff0c\u4e3a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8be5\u6d41\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u521b\u4e0b\u65b0\u8bb0\u5f55\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u9762\u7684\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u8fc7\u6ee4\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027", "conclusion": "OCR\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u683c\u5f0f\u654f\u611f\u6587\u6863\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0cFD-RL\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u71b5\u6a21\u5f0f\u8fdb\u884c\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u683c\u5f0f\u654f\u611f\u6587\u6863\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3aOCR\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6"}}

The aim of this study is to evaluate the potential of synthetic anatomical data for improving machine learning-based personalized computed tomography (CT) dosimetry. It is investigated whether the combination of synthetic human body geometries with real patient data can improve model accuracy and generalization for CT organ dose estimation while maintaining the uncertainty requirements outlined in IAEA TRS-457. Deep learning models for organ dose prediction are trained using datasets with varying proportions of real and synthetic data. Synthetic datasets are generated from computational human phantoms with controlled distributions of organ volumes and body. A dedicated model uncertainty evaluation method is implemented to quantify prediction reliability and verify compliance with TRS-457 accuracy limits. Model performance and uncertainty are compared across different training data compositions, including a model trained solely on real patient data. As baseline validated Monte Carlo simulation is used. Models trained solely on synthetic data show limited predictive accuracy, particularly for small or peripheral organs. Incorporating as little as 10 % real patient data significantly improves both statistical accuracy and uncertainty estimates, achieving a performance comparable to that of real-only models. The hybrid training approach improves robustness across different anatomies while maintaining TRS-457-compliant uncertainty levels (k=2 uncertainty < 20% for adults). The results indicate that the combination of real and synthetic data in combination with a systematic uncertainty assessment supports the development of CT dosimetry models and at the same time reduces the amount of real data required.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5408\u6210\u89e3\u5256\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2a\u6027\u5316CT\u5242\u91cf\u5b66\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7ed3\u5408\u5c11\u91cf\u771f\u5b9e\u60a3\u8005\u6570\u636e\uff0810%\uff09\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3IAEA TRS-457\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e2a\u6027\u5316CT\u5242\u91cf\u5b66\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u60a3\u8005\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u8f90\u5c04\u66b4\u9732\u3001\u652f\u6301\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u4e34\u5e8a\u65b9\u6848\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u5408\u6210\u89e3\u5256\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u6539\u8fdb\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316CT\u5242\u91cf\u5b66\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u6bd4\u4f8b\u771f\u5b9e\u548c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\u5b98\u5242\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ece\u8ba1\u7b97\u4eba\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u53d7\u63a7\u7684\u5668\u5b98\u4f53\u79ef\u548c\u8eab\u4f53\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u91cf\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u662f\u5426\u7b26\u5408TRS-457\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9650\u5236\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u7ecf\u8fc7\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6a21\u62df\u4f5c\u4e3a\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5c0f\u5668\u5b98\u6216\u5916\u5468\u5668\u5b98\u3002\u52a0\u5165\u4ec510%\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u60a3\u8005\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u7edf\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u7eaf\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u6df7\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301TRS-457\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6c34\u5e73\uff08\u6210\u4ebak=2\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027<20%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u771f\u5b9e\u548c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u52a0\u4e0a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u652f\u6301CT\u5242\u91cf\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6240\u9700\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u3002"}}

For example, a driver must perceive the road ahead to anticipate available friction and plan actions accordingly. Achieving such proactive adaptation within autonomous frameworks remains a challenge, particularly under rapidly changing conditions. Traditional modeling approaches often struggle to capture abrupt variations in system behavior, while adaptive methods are inherently reactive and may adapt too late to ensure safety. We propose a vision-conditioned variational Bayesian last-layer dynamics model that leverages visual context to anticipate changes in the environment. The model first learns nominal vehicle dynamics and is then fine-tuned with feature-wise affine transformations of latent features, enabling context-aware dynamics prediction.

However, existing deep learningbased methods, including recent spatial-frequency frameworks such as AdaFuse and ASFE-Fusion, often suffer from a fundamental trade-off between global statistical similaritymeasured by correlation coefficient (CC) and mutual information (MI)and local structural fidelity. This paper proposes W-DUALMINE, a reliability-weighted dual-expert fusion framework designed to explicitly resolve this trade-off through architectural constraints and a theoretically grounded loss design. The proposed method introduces dense reliability maps for adaptive modality weighting, a dual-expert fusion strategy combining a global-context spatial expert and a wavelet-domain frequency expert, and a soft gradient-based arbitration mechanism. Furthermore, we employ a residual-to-average fusion paradigm that guarantees the preservation of global correlation while enhancing local details.

This work is derived from the author's Master's research. Code and supplementary materials will be released separately", "summary": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and generative image models have achieved remarkable performance across multimodal tasks, yet their robustness and fairness under input transformations remain insufficiently explored. This work investigates bias propagation and robustness degradation in state-of-the-art vision-language and generative models, with a particular focus on image rotation and distributional shifts. We analyze how rotation-induced perturbations affect model predictions, confidence calibration, and demographic bias patterns. To address these issues, we propose rotation-robust mitigation strategies that combine data augmentation, representation alignment, and model-level regularization. Experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods significantly improve robustness while reducing bias amplification without sacrificing overall performance. This study highlights critical limitations of current multimodal systems and provides practical mitigation techniques for building more reliable and fair AI models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u53d8\u6362\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u56fe\u50cf\u65cb\u8f6c\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65cb\u8f6c\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u53d8\u6362\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u65cb\u8f6c\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u504f\u89c1\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u65cb\u8f6c\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u504f\u89c1\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65cb\u8f6c\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u3001\u8868\u793a\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u7ea7\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u504f\u89c1\u653e\u5927\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u7684AI\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u7f13\u89e3\u6280\u672f\u3002"}}

However, as linear separators only apply to convex sets, these methods require convex approximations of both the robot and obstacles, which becomes an overly conservative assumption in cluttered and narrow environments. In this work, we unequivocally remove this limitation by introducing nonlinear separating hypersurfaces parameterized by polynomial functions. We first generalize the classical separating hyperplane theorem and prove that any two disjoint bounded closed sets in Euclidean space can be separated by a polynomial hypersurface, serving as the theoretical foundation for nonlinear separation of arbitrary geometries. Building on this result, we formulate a nonlinear programming (NLP) problem that jointly optimizes the robot's trajectory and the coefficients of the separating polynomials, enabling geometry-aware collision avoidance without conservative convex simplifications. The optimization remains efficiently solvable using standard NLP solvers. Simulation and real-world experiments with nonconvex robots demonstrate that our method achieves smooth, collision-free, and agile maneuvers in environments where convex-approximation baselines fail.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u8d85\u66f2\u9762\u8fdb\u884c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7ebf\u6027\u5206\u79bb\u5668\u53ea\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u51f8\u96c6\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4efb\u610f\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u7684\u78b0\u649e\u907f\u514d", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u5206\u79bb\u8d85\u5e73\u9762\u8fdb\u884c\u78b0\u649e\u907f\u514d\uff0c\u4f46\u7ebf\u6027\u5206\u79bb\u5668\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u51f8\u96c6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u548c\u969c\u788d\u7269\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e3a\u51f8\u96c6\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u590d\u6742\u72ed\u7a84\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fc7\u4e8e\u4fdd\u5b88", "method": "1. \u63a8\u5e7f\u7ecf\u5178\u5206\u79bb\u8d85\u5e73\u9762\u5b9a\u7406\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4efb\u610f\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e0d\u76f8\u4ea4\u7684\u6709\u754c\u95ed\u96c6\u90fd\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u8d85\u66f2\u9762\u5206\u79bb\uff1b2. \u6784\u5efa\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u5206\u79bb\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u7cfb\u6570\uff1b3. \u4f7f\u7528\u6807\u51c6NLP\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u9ad8\u6548\u6c42\u89e3", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51f8\u8fd1\u4f3c\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e73\u6ed1\u3001\u65e0\u78b0\u649e\u4e14\u654f\u6377\u7684\u673a\u52a8", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u8d85\u66f2\u9762\u8fdb\u884c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u5f7b\u5e95\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u51f8\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4efb\u610f\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u78b0\u649e\u907f\u514d"}}

Organizations successfully implement XR in isolated pilots, yet struggle to scale these into sustained operational deployment, a phenomenon we characterize as the ``Pilot Trap.'' This study examines this phenomenon through a qualitative ecosystem analysis of 17 expert interviews across technology providers, solution integrators, and industrial adopters. We identify a ``Great Inversion'' in adoption barriers: critical constraints have shifted from technological maturity to organizational readiness (e.g., change management, key performance indicator alignment, and political resistance). While hardware ergonomics and usability remain relevant, our findings indicate that systemic misalignments between stakeholder incentives are the primary cause of friction preventing enterprise integration. We conclude that successful industrial XR adoption requires a shift from technology-centric piloting to a problem-first, organizational transformation approach, necessitating explicit ecosystem-level coordination.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5de5\u4e1aXR\u5e94\u7528\u9762\u4e34\"\u8bd5\u70b9\u9677\u9631\"\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u969c\u788d\u5df2\u4ece\u6280\u672f\u6210\u719f\u5ea6\u8f6c\u5411\u7ec4\u7ec7\u51c6\u5907\u5ea6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u6280\u672f\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8bd5\u70b9\u8f6c\u5411\u95ee\u9898\u4f18\u5148\u7684\u7ec4\u7ec7\u8f6c\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1XR\u6280\u672f\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u652f\u6301\u3001\u57f9\u8bad\u548c\u7ef4\u62a4\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u53d8\u9769\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u786c\u4ef6\u5df2\u76f8\u5bf9\u6210\u719f\uff0c\u4f46\u4f01\u4e1a\u666e\u904d\u9762\u4e34\"\u8bd5\u70b9\u9677\u9631\"\u73b0\u8c61\u2014\u2014\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5b64\u7acb\u8bd5\u70b9\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u65bdXR\uff0c\u5374\u96be\u4ee5\u5c06\u5176\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u6301\u7eed\u8fd0\u8425\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u6027\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5bf917\u4f4d\u6765\u81ea\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u3001\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u96c6\u6210\u5546\u548c\u5de5\u4e1a\u91c7\u7528\u8005\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bbf\u8c08", "result": "\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\"\u5927\u53cd\u8f6c\"\u73b0\u8c61\uff1a\u5173\u952e\u7ea6\u675f\u5df2\u4ece\u6280\u672f\u6210\u719f\u5ea6\u8f6c\u5411\u7ec4\u7ec7\u51c6\u5907\u5ea6\uff08\u5982\u53d8\u9769\u7ba1\u7406\u3001KPI\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u653f\u6cbb\u963b\u529b\uff09\u3002\u867d\u7136\u786c\u4ef6\u4eba\u673a\u5de5\u7a0b\u5b66\u548c\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u4ecd\u7136\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4f46\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u6fc0\u52b1\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u9519\u4f4d\u662f\u963b\u788d\u4f01\u4e1a\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u9996\u8981\u539f\u56e0", "conclusion": "\u6210\u529f\u7684\u5de5\u4e1aXR\u91c7\u7528\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u6280\u672f\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u8bd5\u70b9\u8f6c\u5411\u95ee\u9898\u4f18\u5148\u7684\u7ec4\u7ec7\u8f6c\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c42\u9762\u8fdb\u884c\u660e\u786e\u7684\u534f\u8c03"}}

These methods leverage pre-trained diffusion models to reconstruct inputs and measure residuals for distinguishing real from fake images. Their key advantage lies in reducing reliance on dataset-specific artifacts and improving generalization under distribution shifts. However, they are limited by significant inefficiency due to multi-step inversion and reconstruction, and their reliance on diffusion backbones further limits generalization to other generative paradigms such as GANs.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel fake image detection framework, called R$^2$BD, built upon two key designs: (1) G-LDM, a unified reconstruction model that simulates the generation behaviors of VAEs, GANs, and diffusion models, thereby broadening the detection scope beyond prior diffusion-only approaches; and (2) a residual bias calculation module that distinguishes real and fake images in a single inference step, which is a significant efficiency improvement over existing methods that typically require 20$+$ steps.\n  Extensive experiments on the benchmark from 10 public datasets demonstrate that R$^2$BD is over 22$\\times$ faster than existing reconstruction-based methods while achieving superior detection accuracy. In cross-dataset evaluations, it outperforms state-of-the-art methods by an average of 13.87\\%, showing strong efficiency and generalization across diverse generative methods.

We examined whether XR strengthens internal responses to a product, specifically perceived comprehension and empathy, and whether these responses, in turn, influence the behavioural outcome of purchase intention. A repeated-measures two-way ANOVA demonstrated a significant main effect of advertising modality, with XR yielding higher ratings on all evaluative dimensions. Mediation analysis further indicated that the elevation in purchase intention was mediated by empathy, whereas no significant mediating effect was observed for comprehension within the scope of this study.

Despite originating from fundamentally different pathways, both modalities capture the same underlying reality. We establish \\emph{homeomorphism}, a continuous bijection preserving topological structure, as the mathematical criterion for determining when latent manifolds induced by different semantic-observation pairs can be rigorously unified. This criterion provides theoretical guarantees for three critical applications: (1) semantic-guided sparse recovery from incomplete observations, (2) cross-domain transfer learning with verified structural compatibility, and (3) zero-shot compositional learning via valid transfer from semantic to observation space. Our framework learns continuous manifold-to-manifold transformations through conditional variational inference, avoiding brittle point-to-point mappings. We develop practical verification algorithms, including trust, continuity, and Wasserstein distance metrics, that empirically validate homeomorphic structure from finite samples. Experiments demonstrate: (1) sparse image recovery from 5\\% of CelebA pixels and MNIST digit reconstruction at multiple sparsity levels, (2) cross-domain classifier transfer achieving 86.73\\% accuracy from MNIST to Fashion-MNIST without retraining, and (3) zero-shot classification on unseen classes achieving 89.47\\% on MNIST, 84.70\\% on Fashion-MNIST, and 78.76\\% on CIFAR-10.

Existing trajectory planners exhibit systematic failures in these scenarios due to data imbalance. This results in insufficient modelling of vehicle dynamics, road geometry, and environmental constraints in high-risk situations, leading to suboptimal or unsafe trajectory prediction when vehicles operate near their physical limits. In this paper, we introduce ReflexDiffusion, a novel inference-stage framework that enhances diffusion-based trajectory planners through reflective adjustment. Our method introduces a gradient-based adjustment mechanism during the iterative denoising process: after each standard trajectory update, we compute the gradient between the conditional and unconditional noise predictions to explicitly amplify critical conditioning signals, including road curvature and lateral vehicle dynamics. This amplification enforces strict adherence to physical constraints, particularly improving stability during high-lateral-acceleration maneuvers where precise vehicle-road interaction is paramount. Evaluated on the nuPlan Test14-hard benchmark, ReflexDiffusion achieves a 14.1% improvement in driving score for high-lateral-acceleration scenarios over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. This demonstrates that inference-time trajectory optimization can effectively compensate for training data sparsity by dynamically reinforcing safety-critical constraints near handling limits. The framework's architecture-agnostic design enables direct deployment to existing diffusion-based planners, offering a practical solution for improving autonomous vehicle safety in challenging driving conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "ReflexDiffusion\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u5c04\u8c03\u6574\u589e\u5f3a\u6269\u6563\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u9ad8\u901f\u6a2a\u5411\u52a0\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u6025\u8f6c\u5f2f\uff09\uff0c\u5728nuPlan Test14-hard\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u76f8\u6bd4SOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u534714.1%\u9a7e\u9a76\u5206\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u5728\u957f\u5c3e\u573a\u666f\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9ad8\u901f\u6a2a\u5411\u52a0\u901f\u5ea6\u64cd\u4f5c\u5982\u6025\u8f6c\u5f2f\uff09\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u8f66\u8f86\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3001\u9053\u8def\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u73af\u5883\u7ea6\u675f\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5f53\u8f66\u8f86\u63a5\u8fd1\u7269\u7406\u6781\u9650\u65f6\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u6b21\u4f18\u6216\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "ReflexDiffusion\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u8fed\u4ee3\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u8c03\u6574\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u6807\u51c6\u8f68\u8ff9\u66f4\u65b0\u540e\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6761\u4ef6\u566a\u58f0\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u566a\u58f0\u9884\u6d4b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u653e\u5927\u5173\u952e\u6761\u4ef6\u4fe1\u53f7\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u9053\u8def\u66f2\u7387\u548c\u6a2a\u5411\u8f66\u8f86\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff09\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5f3a\u5316\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u9075\u5b88\u3002", "result": "\u5728nuPlan Test14-hard\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cReflexDiffusion\u5728\u9ad8\u901f\u6a2a\u5411\u52a0\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8614.1%\u7684\u9a7e\u9a76\u5206\u6570\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u8865\u507f\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u65e0\u5173\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u90e8\u7f72\u5230\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e3a\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u9a7e\u9a76\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u63d0\u9ad8\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u80fd\u591f\u52a8\u6001\u5f3a\u5316\u63a5\u8fd1\u64cd\u63a7\u6781\u9650\u65f6\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u7ea6\u675f\u3002"}}

To address this challenge, we propose POWDR, a pathology-preserving outpainting framework for 3D MRI based on a conditioned wavelet diffusion model. Unlike conventional augmentation or unconditional synthesis, POWDR retains real pathological regions while generating anatomically plausible surrounding tissue, enabling diversity without fabricating lesions.\n  Our approach leverages wavelet-domain conditioning to enhance high-frequency detail and mitigate blurring common in latent diffusion models. We introduce a random connected mask training strategy to overcome conditioning-induced collapse and improve diversity outside the lesion. POWDR is evaluated on brain MRI using BraTS datasets and extended to knee MRI to demonstrate tissue-agnostic applicability. Quantitative metrics (FID, SSIM, LPIPS) confirm image realism, while diversity analysis shows significant improvement with random-mask training (cosine similarity reduced from 0.9947 to 0.9580; KL divergence increased from 0.00026 to 0.01494). Clinically relevant assessments reveal gains in tumor segmentation performance using nnU-Net, with Dice scores improving from 0.6992 to 0.7137 when adding 50 synthetic cases. Tissue volume analysis indicates no significant differences for CSF and GM compared to real images.\n  These findings highlight POWDR as a practical solution for addressing data scarcity and class imbalance in medical imaging.

We present ForensicFormer, a hierarchical multi-scale framework that unifies low-level artifact detection, mid-level boundary analysis, and high-level semantic reasoning via cross-attention transformers. Unlike prior single-paradigm approaches, which achieve <75% accuracy on out-of-distribution datasets, our method maintains 86.8% average accuracy across seven diverse test sets, spanning traditional manipulations, GAN-generated images, and diffusion model outputs - a significant improvement over state-of-the-art universal detectors. We demonstrate superior robustness to JPEG compression (83% accuracy at Q=70 vs. 66% for baselines) and provide pixel-level forgery localization with a 0.76 F1-score. Extensive ablation studies validate that each hierarchical component contributes 4-10% accuracy improvement, and qualitative analysis reveals interpretable forensic features aligned with human expert reasoning.

We address this by conducting the first large-scale study of how data quantity and data diversity affect real-world generalization in end-to-end, map-free visual navigation. Using a curated 4,565-hour crowd-sourced dataset collected across 161 locations in 35 countries, we train policies for point goal navigation and evaluate their closed-loop control performance on sidewalk robots operating in four countries, covering 125 km of autonomous driving.\n  Our results show that large-scale training data enables zero-shot navigation in unknown environments, approaching the performance of policies trained with environment-specific demonstrations. Critically, we find that data diversity is far more important than data quantity. Doubling the number of geographical locations in a training set decreases navigation errors by ~15%, while performance benefit from adding data from existing locations saturates with very little data.

However, for non-experts, especially those without programming skills, it isn't easy to customize a visualizable environment by themselves. In this paper, we introduce World Craft, an agentic world creation framework to create an executable and visualizable AI Town via user textual descriptions. It consists of two main modules, World Scaffold and World Guild. World Scaffold is a structured and concise standardization to develop interactive game scenes, serving as an efficient scaffolding for LLMs to customize an executable AI Town-like environment.

We propose SAR-Net, a unified framework that addresses this challenge through principled scene-appearance disentanglement. Our key insight is that observed images can be decomposed into domain-invariant scene representations and domain-specific appearance codes, enabling registration via re-rendering rather than direct intensity matching. We establish theoretical conditions under which this decomposition enables consistent cross-domain alignment (Proposition 1) and prove that our scene consistency loss provides a sufficient condition for geometric correspondence in the shared latent space (Proposition 2). Empirically, we validate SAR-Net on bidirectional scanning microscopy, where coupled domain shift and geometric distortion create a challenging real-world testbed. Our method achieves 0.885 SSIM and 0.979 NCC, representing 3.1x improvement over the strongest baseline, while maintaining real-time performance (77 fps). Ablation studies confirm that both scene consistency and domain alignment losses are necessary: removing either degrades performance by 90% SSIM or causes 223x increase in latent alignment error, respectively.

However, since this recipe updates existing representations, it is unsuitable for long-term operation in the real world, where robots must continually adapt to new tasks and environments while retaining the knowledge they have already acquired. Existing continual learning methods for robotics commonly require storing previous data (exemplars), struggle with long task sequences, or rely on task identifiers for deployment. To address these limitations, we propose CLARE, a general, parameter-efficient framework for exemplar-free continual learning with VLAs. CLARE introduces lightweight modular adapters into selected feedforward layers and autonomously expands the model only where necessary when learning a new task, guided by layer-wise feature similarity. During deployment, an autoencoder-based routing mechanism dynamically activates the most relevant adapters without requiring task labels. Through extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark, we show that CLARE achieves high performance on new tasks without catastrophic forgetting of earlier tasks, significantly outperforming even exemplar-based methods.

However, many of these systems have problems keeping users satisfied and engaged over long periods. This paper argues that these problems do not come mainly from weak models, but from poor character design and unclear definitions of the user-AI relationship. I present Mikasa, an emotional AI companion inspired by Japanese Oshi culture-specifically its emphasis on long-term, non-exclusive commitment to a stable character-as a case study of character-driven companion design. Mikasa does not work as a general-purpose assistant or a chatbot that changes roles. Instead, Mikasa is designed as a coherent character with a stable personality and a clearly defined relationship as a partner. This relationship does not force exclusivity or obligation. Rather, it works as a reference point that stabilizes interaction norms and reduces the work users must do to keep redefining the relationship. Through an exploratory evaluation, I see that users describe their preferences using surface-level qualities such as conversational naturalness, but they also value relationship control and imaginative engagement in ways they do not state directly. These results suggest that character coherence and relationship definition work as latent structural elements that shape how good the interaction feels, without users recognizing them as main features. The contribution of this work is to show that character design is a functional part of AI companion systems, not just decoration. Mikasa is one example based on a specific cultural context, but the design principles-commitment to a consistent personality and clear relationship definition-can be used for many emotionally grounded AI companions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faMikasa\u60c5\u611fAI\u4f34\u4fa3\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u65e5\u672c\u63a8\u3057\u6587\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u7a33\u5b9a\u89d2\u8272\u548c\u660e\u786e\u5173\u7cfb\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u8ffd\u6c42\u901a\u7528\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89d2\u8272\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u671f\u7528\u6237\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dAI\u4f34\u4fa3\u7cfb\u7edf\u867d\u7136\u5177\u5907\u6d41\u7545\u5bf9\u8bdd\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u7ef4\u6301\u7528\u6237\u957f\u671f\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u548c\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\u95ee\u9898\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u89d2\u8272\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0d\u4f73\u548c\u7528\u6237-AI\u5173\u7cfb\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u65e5\u672c\u63a8\u3057\u6587\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1Mikasa\u60c5\u611fAI\u4f34\u4fa3\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u957f\u671f\u975e\u6392\u4ed6\u6027\u627f\u8bfa\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u89d2\u8272\u3002Mikasa\u88ab\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u683c\u548c\u660e\u786e\u5173\u7cfb\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u8fde\u8d2f\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u901a\u7528\u52a9\u624b\u6216\u53ef\u53d8\u89d2\u8272\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u3002", "result": "\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u8868\u9762\u5173\u6ce8\u5bf9\u8bdd\u81ea\u7136\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u6df1\u5c42\u91cd\u89c6\u5173\u7cfb\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u60f3\u8c61\u53c2\u4e0e\u3002\u89d2\u8272\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u5b9a\u4e49\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6f5c\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5143\u7d20\u5f71\u54cd\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f53\u9a8c\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u7528\u6237\u672a\u76f4\u63a5\u5c06\u5176\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89d2\u8272\u8bbe\u8ba1\u662fAI\u4f34\u4fa3\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\u800c\u975e\u88c5\u9970\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u6587\u5316\u80cc\u666f\u7684Mikasa\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u627f\u8bfa\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u683c\u548c\u660e\u786e\u5173\u7cfb\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\u53ef\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u60c5\u611fAI\u4f34\u4fa3\u3002"}}

Early studies have combined manual engineering with deep neural networks, achieving notable progress in specific semantic-related embodied tasks. However, as embodied agents encounter increasingly complex environments and open-ended tasks, the demand for more generalizable and robust semantic processing capabilities has become imperative. Recent advances in foundation models (FMs) address this challenge through their cross-domain generalization abilities and rich semantic priors, reshaping the landscape of embodied AI research. In this survey, we propose the Semantic Lifecycle as a unified framework to characterize the evolution of semantic knowledge within embodied AI driven by foundation models. Departing from traditional paradigms that treat semantic processing as isolated modules or disjoint tasks, our framework offers a holistic perspective that captures the continuous flow and maintenance of semantic knowledge. Guided by this embodied semantic lifecycle, we further analyze and compare recent advances across three key stages: acquisition, representation, and storage. Finally, we summarize existing challenges and outline promising directions for future research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\"\u8bed\u4e49\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\"\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63cf\u8ff0\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5177\u8eabAI\u4e2d\u8bed\u4e49\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u6f14\u53d8\uff0c\u4ece\u83b7\u53d6\u3001\u8868\u793a\u5230\u5b58\u50a8\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u9636\u6bb5\u5206\u6790\u6700\u65b0\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u5177\u8eabAI\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u5177\u6709\u591a\u6e90\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u611f\u77e5-\u52a8\u4f5c\u5faa\u73af\u3002\u968f\u7740\u73af\u5883\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u901a\u7528\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u6311\u6218\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\"\u8bed\u4e49\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\"\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u8bed\u4e49\u5904\u7406\u89c6\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u6d41\u548c\u7ef4\u62a4\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5b64\u7acb\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u6216\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u6790\u8bed\u4e49\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u83b7\u53d6\u3001\u8868\u793a\u548c\u5b58\u50a8\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u9636\u6bb5\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5177\u8eabAI\u8bed\u4e49\u5904\u7406\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5206\u6790\u8bed\u4e49\u77e5\u8bc6\u6f14\u53d8\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u6bd4\u8f83\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u6b63\u5728\u91cd\u5851\u5177\u8eabAI\u7814\u7a76\u683c\u5c40\uff0c\u8bed\u4e49\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u8bed\u4e49\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u6d41\u52a8\u548c\u7ef4\u62a4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6574\u4f53\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u6311\u6218\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

While leveraging abundant Human-Human Interaction (HHI) data presents a scalable alternative, we first demonstrate that standard retargeting fails by breaking the essential contacts. We address this with PAIR (Physics-Aware Interaction Retargeting), a contact-centric, two-stage pipeline that preserves contact semantics across morphology differences to generate physically consistent HHoI data. This high-quality data, however, exposes a second failure: conventional imitation learning policies merely mimic trajectories and lack interactive understanding. We therefore introduce D-STAR (Decoupled Spatio-Temporal Action Reasoner), a hierarchical policy that disentangles when to act from where to act. In D-STAR, Phase Attention (when) and a Multi-Scale Spatial module (where) are fused by the diffusion head to produce synchronized whole-body behaviors beyond mimicry. By decoupling these reasoning streams, our model learns robust temporal phases without being distracted by spatial noise, leading to responsive, synchronized collaboration.

They enable users to translate their physical movements into corresponding avatar movements in real-time, allowing them to perceive their avatars via the displays. Consumer-grade IVR systems have been available for 10 years, significantly fostering VR research worldwide. However, the effects of even apparently significant technological advances of IVR systems on user experience and the overall validity of prior embodiment research using such systems often remain unclear. We ran a user-centered study comparing two comparable IVR generations: a nearly 10-year-old hardware (HTC Vive, 6-point tracking) and a modern counterpart (HTC Vive Pro 2, 6-point tracking). To ensure ecological validity, we evaluated the systems in their commercially available, as-is configurations. In a 2x5 mixed design, participants completed five tasks covering different use cases on either the old or new system. We assessed presence, sense of embodiment, appearance and behavior plausibility, workload, task performance, and gathered qualitative feedback. Results showed no significant system differences, with only small effect sizes. Bayesian analysis further supported the null hypothesis, suggesting that the investigated generational hardware improvements offer limited benefits for user experience and task performance.

To address this problem, we propose DeTracker, a joint detection-and-tracking framework tailored for unstabilized satellite videos. DeTracker introduces a Global--Local Motion Decoupling (GLMD) module that explicitly separates satellite platform motion from true object motion through global alignment and local refinement, leading to improved trajectory stability and motion estimation accuracy. In addition, a Temporal Dependency Feature Pyramid (TDFP) module is developed to perform cross-frame temporal feature fusion, enhancing the continuity and discriminability of tiny-object representations. We further construct a new benchmark dataset, SDM-Car-SU, which simulates multi-directional and multi-speed platform motions to enable systematic evaluation of tracking robustness under varying motion perturbations. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real unstabilized satellite videos demonstrate that DeTracker significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving 61.1% MOTA on SDM-Car-SU and 47.3% MOTA on real satellite video data.", "AI": {"tldr": "DeTracker\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u975e\u7a33\u5b9a\u536b\u661f\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u5c40-\u5c40\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u89e3\u8026\u6a21\u5757\u5206\u79bb\u5e73\u53f0\u6296\u52a8\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u76ee\u6807\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u5e8f\u4f9d\u8d56\u7279\u5f81\u91d1\u5b57\u5854\u589e\u5f3a\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u536b\u661f\u89c6\u9891\u63d0\u4f9b\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\u5730\u8868\u52a8\u6001\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u975e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff08\u5e73\u53f0\u6296\u52a8\u548c\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u5916\u89c2\u5f31\uff09\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6027\u80fd\u4e25\u91cd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDeTracker\u8054\u5408\u68c0\u6d4b\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) GLMD\u6a21\u5757\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u5c40\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u7ec6\u5316\u5206\u79bb\u536b\u661f\u5e73\u53f0\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u76ee\u6807\u8fd0\u52a8\uff1b2) TDFP\u6a21\u5757\u8fdb\u884c\u8de8\u5e27\u65f6\u5e8f\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u589e\u5f3a\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u8868\u5f81\uff1b3) \u6784\u5efaSDM-Car-SU\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6a21\u62df\u591a\u65b9\u5411\u591a\u901f\u5ea6\u5e73\u53f0\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u96c6SDM-Car-SU\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523061.1% MOTA\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u536b\u661f\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523047.3% MOTA\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u975e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u8ddf\u8e2a\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "DeTracker\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd0\u52a8\u89e3\u8026\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u7279\u5f81\u589e\u5f3a\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u975e\u7a33\u5b9a\u536b\u661f\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u536b\u661f\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This paper presents a novel method for semantically enhancing 3D point cloud maps with thermal information. By first performing pixel-level fusion of visible and infrared images, the system projects real-time LiDAR point clouds onto this fused image stream. It then segments heat source features in the thermal channel to instantly identify high temperature targets and applies this temperature information as a semantic layer on the final 3D map.

How the Level of Detail about AI Use in News Writing Affects Readers' Trust", "comment": null, "summary": "As artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly integrated into news production, calls for transparency about the use of AI have gained considerable traction. Recent studies suggest that AI disclosures can lead to a ``transparency dilemma'', where disclosure reduces readers' trust. However, little is known about how the \\textit{level of detail} in AI disclosures influences trust and contributes to this dilemma within the news context. In this 3$\\times$2$\\times$2 mixed factorial study with 40 participants, we investigate how three levels of AI disclosures (none, one-line, detailed) across two types of news (politics and lifestyle) and two levels of AI involvement (low and high) affect news readers' trust. We measured trust using the News Media Trust questionnaire, along with two decision behaviors: source-checking and subscription decisions. Questionnaire responses and subscription rates showed a decline in trust only for detailed AI disclosures, whereas source-checking behavior increased for both one-line and detailed disclosures, with the effect being more pronounced for detailed disclosures. Insights from semi-structured interviews suggest that source-checking behavior was primarily driven by interest in the topic, followed by trust, whereas trust was the main factor influencing subscription decisions. Around two-thirds of participants expressed a preference for detailed disclosures, while most participants who preferred one-line indicated a need for detail-on-demand disclosure formats. Our findings show that not all AI disclosures lead to a transparency dilemma, but instead reflect a trade-off between readers' desire for more transparency and their trust in AI-assisted news content.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0AI\u65b0\u95fb\u62ab\u9732\u7684\u8be6\u7ec6\u7a0b\u5ea6\u5bf9\u8bfb\u8005\u4fe1\u4efb\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u5f71\u54cd\uff1a\u8be6\u7ec6\u62ab\u9732\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u4fe1\u4efb\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u4fe1\u606f\u6838\u67e5\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b\u8bfb\u8005\u504f\u597d\u8be6\u7ec6\u62ab\u9732\uff0c\u4f46\u5e0c\u671b\u6309\u9700\u83b7\u53d6\u7ec6\u8282\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI\u5728\u65b0\u95fb\u751f\u4ea7\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u8981\u6c42\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u52a0\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660eAI\u62ab\u9732\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\"\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u56f0\u5883\"\u2014\u2014\u62ab\u9732\u53cd\u800c\u964d\u4f4e\u8bfb\u8005\u4fe1\u4efb\u3002\u4f46\u5173\u4e8eAI\u62ab\u9732\u8be6\u7ec6\u7a0b\u5ea6\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4fe1\u4efb\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5c1a\u4e0d\u5145\u5206\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u75283\u00d72\u00d72\u6df7\u5408\u56e0\u5b50\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c40\u540d\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u3002\u4e09\u4e2aAI\u62ab\u9732\u6c34\u5e73\uff08\u65e0\u3001\u5355\u884c\u3001\u8be6\u7ec6\uff09\u00d7\u4e24\u79cd\u65b0\u95fb\u7c7b\u578b\uff08\u653f\u6cbb\u3001\u751f\u6d3b\uff09\u00d7\u4e24\u79cdAI\u53c2\u4e0e\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff08\u4f4e\u3001\u9ad8\uff09\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u95fb\u5a92\u4f53\u4fe1\u4efb\u95ee\u5377\u6d4b\u91cf\u4fe1\u4efb\uff0c\u5e76\u89c2\u5bdf\u4e24\u79cd\u51b3\u7b56\u884c\u4e3a\uff1a\u4fe1\u606f\u6e90\u6838\u67e5\u548c\u8ba2\u9605\u51b3\u7b56\u3002\u8f85\u4ee5\u534a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bbf\u8c08\u3002", "result": "\u95ee\u5377\u548c\u8ba2\u9605\u7387\u663e\u793a\uff1a\u53ea\u6709\u8be6\u7ec6AI\u62ab\u9732\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u4fe1\u4efb\uff1b\u5355\u884c\u548c\u8be6\u7ec6\u62ab\u9732\u90fd\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u4fe1\u606f\u6e90\u6838\u67e5\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u8be6\u7ec6\u62ab\u9732\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u660e\u663e\u3002\u8bbf\u8c08\u8868\u660e\uff1a\u4fe1\u606f\u6e90\u6838\u67e5\u4e3b\u8981\u53d7\u8bdd\u9898\u5174\u8da3\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u5176\u6b21\u662f\u4fe1\u4efb\uff1b\u4fe1\u4efb\u662f\u5f71\u54cd\u8ba2\u9605\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\u7ea6\u4e09\u5206\u4e4b\u4e8c\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u504f\u597d\u8be6\u7ec6\u62ab\u9732\uff0c\u504f\u597d\u5355\u884c\u62ab\u9732\u7684\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u5927\u591a\u5e0c\u671b\u6309\u9700\u83b7\u53d6\u7ec6\u8282\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e76\u975e\u6240\u6709AI\u62ab\u9732\u90fd\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u56f0\u5883\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u8bfb\u8005\u5bf9\u66f4\u9ad8\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u4e0e\u5bf9AI\u8f85\u52a9\u65b0\u95fb\u5185\u5bb9\u4fe1\u4efb\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002\u8be6\u7ec6\u62ab\u9732\u867d\u7136\u964d\u4f4e\u4fe1\u4efb\uff0c\u4f46\u80fd\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4fe1\u606f\u6838\u67e5\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e14\u591a\u6570\u8bfb\u8005\u504f\u597d\u8be6\u7ec6\u62ab\u9732\u3002"}}

While redirected walking research has shown that users' movements can be subtly manipulated without detection, similar imperceptible adjustments for teleportation have not been systematically investigated. This study examines the thresholds at which teleportation displacements become noticeable to users. We conducted a repeated-measures experiment in which participants' selected teleport destinations were altered in both direction (forwards, backwards) and at different ranges (small, large). Detection thresholds for these positional adjustments were estimated using a psychophysical staircase method with a two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) task. Results show that teleport destinations can be shifted without detection, with larger tolerances for backward adjustments and across longer teleport ranges. These findings establish baseline perceptual limits for redirected teleportation and highlight its potential as a design technique. Applications include supporting interpersonal distance management in social VR, guiding players toward objectives in games, and assisting novice users with navigation. By identifying the limits of imperceptible teleportation adjustments, this work extends redirection principles beyond walking to teleportation and opens new opportunities for adaptive and socially aware VR locomotion systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u865a\u62df\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u4f20\u9001\u6280\u672f\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4f20\u9001\u76ee\u7684\u5730\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u88ab\u5bdf\u89c9\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u5411\u540e\u8c03\u6574\u548c\u8f83\u957f\u4f20\u9001\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u5bb9\u5fcd\u5ea6\u66f4\u5927\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u9001\u662fVR\u4e2d\u6700\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u6280\u672f\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u611f\u77e5\u7279\u6027\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u867d\u7136\u91cd\u5b9a\u5411\u884c\u8d70\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u7528\u6237\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u5fae\u5999\u64cd\u7eb5\u800c\u4e0d\u88ab\u5bdf\u89c9\uff0c\u4f46\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u5bdf\u89c9\u4f20\u9001\u8c03\u6574\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u91cd\u590d\u6d4b\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684\u4f20\u9001\u76ee\u7684\u5730\u88ab\u8c03\u6574\u65b9\u5411\u548c\u8303\u56f4\uff08\u5411\u524d/\u5411\u540e\uff0c\u5c0f/\u5927\u8303\u56f4\uff09\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u5fc3\u7406\u7269\u7406\u9636\u68af\u6cd5\u548c\u4e8c\u9009\u4e00\u5f3a\u5236\u9009\u62e9\u4efb\u52a1\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u9608\u503c\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u4f20\u9001\u76ee\u7684\u5730\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u88ab\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u5411\u540e\u8c03\u6574\u548c\u8f83\u957f\u4f20\u9001\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u5bb9\u5fcd\u5ea6\u66f4\u5927\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u91cd\u5b9a\u5411\u4f20\u9001\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u57fa\u7ebf\u611f\u77e5\u9650\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u5c06\u91cd\u5b9a\u5411\u539f\u5219\u4ece\u884c\u8d70\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u4f20\u9001\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u793e\u4ea4\u611f\u77e5\u7684VR\u79fb\u52a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u673a\u4f1a\uff0c\u53ef\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u793e\u4ea4VR\u4e2d\u7684\u4eba\u9645\u8ddd\u79bb\u7ba1\u7406\u3001\u6e38\u620f\u76ee\u6807\u5f15\u5bfc\u548c\u65b0\u624b\u5bfc\u822a\u8f85\u52a9\u3002"}}

Departing from conventional pre-training methods for video understanding that rely on pixel-level reconstructions, V-JEPAs learn by predicting embeddings of masked regions from the embeddings of unmasked regions. This enables the trained encoder to not capture irrelevant information about a given video like the color of a region of pixels in the background. Using a pre-trained V-JEPA video encoder, we train shallow classifiers using the RAVDESS and CREMA-D datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on RAVDESS and outperforming all other vision-based methods on CREMA-D (+1.48 WAR). Furthermore, cross-dataset evaluations reveal strong generalization capabilities, demonstrating the potential of purely embedding-based pre-training approaches to advance FER.

Our smoothing-regularized loss augments binary cross-entropy with a variance penalty across stochas- tic forward passes, discouraging spurious fluctuations and yielding spatially coherent masks. On BraTS2023, UAMSA- UNet improves Dice Similarity Coefficient by up to 3.3% and mean IoU by up to 2.7% over U-Net; on BraTS2024, it delivers up to 4.5% Dice and 4.0% IoU gains over the best baseline. Remarkably, it also reduces FLOPs by 42.5% rel- ative to U-Net++ while maintaining higher accuracy.

Robot demonstration data is scarce and often lacks appropriate variation in camera viewpoints. Simulation offers a way to collect robot demonstrations at scale with comprehensive coverage of different viewpoints, but presents a visual sim2real challenge. To bridge this gap, we propose MANGO -- an unpaired image translation method with a novel segmentation-conditioned InfoNCE loss, a highly-regularized discriminator design, and a modified PatchNCE loss. We find that these elements are crucial for maintaining viewpoint consistency during sim2real translation. When training MANGO, we only require a small amount of fixed-camera data from the real world, but show that our method can generate diverse unseen viewpoints by translating simulated observations. In this domain, MANGO outperforms all other image translation methods we tested.

This paper introduces Thermo-LIO, a novel multi-sensor system that can enhance Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) by fusing thermal imaging with high-resolution LiDAR. To achieve this, the study first develops a multimodal fusion method combining thermal imaging and LiDAR, enabling precise calibration and synchronization of multimodal data streams to create accurate representations of temperature distributions in buildings. Second, it integrates this fusion approach with LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO), enabling full coverage of large-scale structures and allowing for detailed monitoring of temperature variations and defect detection across inspection cycles. Experimental validations, including case studies on a bridge and a hall building, demonstrate that Thermo-LIO can detect detailed thermal anomalies and structural defects more accurately than traditional methods.

This enables reasoning-enhanced policy learning that effectively connects compact reasoning to action execution.

During inference, we simplify prompting by selecting only the three keypoints with the highest visibility. This strategy reduces sensitivity to common errors, such as missing body parts or misclassified clothing, and allows accurate mask prediction from as few as a single keypoint.

Despite these achievements, existing methods universally employ sparse sampling during training--utilizing only one template and one search image per sequence--which fails to comprehensively explore spatiotemporal information in videos. This limitation constrains performance and cause the gap between lightweight and high-performance trackers. To bridge this divide while maintaining real-time efficiency, we propose STDTrack, a framework that pioneers the integration of reliable spatiotemporal dependencies into lightweight trackers. Our approach implements dense video sampling to maximize spatiotemporal information utilization. We introduce a temporally propagating spatiotemporal token to guide per-frame feature extraction. To ensure comprehensive target state representation, we disign the Multi-frame Information Fusion Module (MFIFM), which augments current dependencies using historical context. The MFIFM operates on features stored in our constructed Spatiotemporal Token Maintainer (STM), where a quality-based update mechanism ensures information reliability.

Existing methods are typically built upon moderate-scale pre-trained models and employ diverse optimization strategies to achieve promising performance under full-parameter fine-tuning. In fact, deeper and larger-scale foundation models can provide stronger support for performance improvement. However, due to their massive number of parameters, directly adopting full-parameter fine-tuning leads to pronounced training difficulties, such as excessive GPU memory consumption and high computational costs, which result in extremely limited exploration of large-scale models in existing works. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic wavelet expert-guided fine-tuning paradigm with fewer trainable parameters, dubbed WEFT, which efficiently adapts large-scale foundation models to ORSIs segmentation tasks by leveraging the guidance of wavelet experts. Specifically, we introduce a task-specific wavelet expert extractor to model wavelet experts from different perspectives and dynamically regulate their outputs, thereby generating trainable features enriched with task-specific information for subsequent fine-tuning. Furthermore, we construct an expert-guided conditional adapter that first enhances the fine-grained perception of frozen features for specific tasks by injecting trainable features, and then iteratively updates the information of both types of feature, allowing for efficient fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that our WEFT not only outperforms 21 state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on three ORSIs datasets, but also achieves optimal results in camouflage, natural, and medical scenarios.

While state-of-the-art models perform well under full supervision, their performance degrades significantly under limited labeling, limiting their real-world applicability. In this work, we propose SAM-Aug, a new annotation-efficient framework that leverages the geometry-aware segmentation capability of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to improve few-shot land cover mapping. Our approach constructs cloud-free composite images from temporal sequences and applies SAM in a fully unsupervised manner to generate geometry-aware mask priors. These priors are then integrated into training through a proposed loss function called RegionSmoothLoss, which enforces prediction consistency within each SAM-derived region across temporal frames, effectively regularizing the model to respect semantically coherent structures. Extensive experiments on the PASTIS-R benchmark under a 5 percent labeled setting demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of SAM-Aug. Averaged over three random seeds (42, 2025, 4090), our method achieves a mean test mIoU of 36.21 percent, outperforming the state-of-the-art baseline by +2.33 percentage points, a relative improvement of 6.89 percent. Notably, on the most favorable split (seed=42), SAM-Aug reaches a test mIoU of 40.28 percent, representing an 11.2 percent relative gain with no additional labeled data. The consistent improvement across all seeds confirms the generalization power of leveraging foundation model priors under annotation scarcity. Our results highlight that vision models like SAM can serve as useful regularizers in few-shot remote sensing learning, offering a scalable and plug-and-play solution for land cover monitoring without requiring manual annotations or model fine-tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSAM-Aug\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528Segment Anything Model\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u5272\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u4ec5\u67095%\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u751f\u6210\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u63a9\u7801\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408RegionSmoothLoss\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5168\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u6807\u6ce8\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u65f6\u5e8f\u65e0\u4e91\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5e94\u7528SAM\u751f\u6210\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u63a9\u7801\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u63d0\u51faRegionSmoothLoss\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5f3a\u5236\u540c\u4e00SAM\u533a\u57df\u5728\u65f6\u5e8f\u5e27\u5185\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7ea6\u675f\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5728PASTIS-R\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u76845%\u6807\u6ce8\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u6d4b\u8bd5mIoU\u8fbe\u523036.21%\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f73\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u53472.33\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff08\u76f8\u5bf9\u63d0\u53476.89%\uff09\u3002\u6700\u4f18\u5206\u5272\uff08seed=42\uff09\u8fbe\u523040.28% mIoU\uff0c\u76f8\u5bf9\u63d0\u534711.2%\u3002", "conclusion": "SAM\u7b49\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u9065\u611f\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6216\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6807\u6ce8\u7a00\u7f3a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u571f\u5730\u8986\u76d6\u76d1\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

The prevailing \"restoration-then-recognition\" two-stage paradigm suffers from a fundamental flaw: the pixel-level optimization objectives of image restoration models are misaligned with the semantic goals of character recognition, leading to artifact interference and error accumulation. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated powerful general capabilities, they lack explicit structural modeling for license plate character sequences (e.g., fixed length, specific order). To address this, we propose an end-to-end structure-aware multimodal reasoning framework based on Qwen3-VL. The core innovation lies in the Character-Aware Multimodal Reasoning Module (CMRM), which introduces a set of learnable Character Slot Queries. Through a cross-attention mechanism, these queries actively retrieve fine-grained evidence corresponding to character positions from visual features. Subsequently, we inject these character-aware representations back into the visual tokens via residual modulation, enabling the language model to perform autoregressive generation based on explicit structural priors. Furthermore, combined with the LoRA parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy, the model achieves domain adaptation while retaining the generalization capabilities of the large model.

In this paper, we challenge the assumption that parameter scaling is the only path to medical precision. We introduce SkinFlow, a framework that treats diagnosis as an optimization of visual information transmission efficiency. Our approach utilizes a Virtual-Width Dynamic Vision Encoder (DVE) to \"unfold\" complex pathological manifolds without physical parameter expansion, coupled with a two-stage Reinforcement Learning strategy. This strategy sequentially aligns explicit medical descriptions (Stage I) and reconstructs implicit diagnostic textures (Stage II) within a constrained semantic space. Furthermore, we propose a clinically grounded evaluation protocol that prioritizes diagnostic safety and hierarchical relevance over rigid label matching. Empirical results are compelling: our 7B model establishes a new state-of-the-art on the Fitzpatrick17k benchmark, achieving a +12.06% gain in Top-1 accuracy and a +28.57% boost in Top-6 accuracy over the massive general-purpose models (e.g., Qwen3VL-235B and GPT-5.2).

We evaluated five widely used GenAI image platforms (Adobe Firefly, DALL-E 3, Google Imagen 3, Microsoft Image Generator, and Midjourney) using 30 architectural prompts spanning styles, typologies, and codified elements. Each prompt-generator pair produced four images (n = 600 images total). Two architectural historians independently scored each image for accuracy against predefined criteria, resolving disagreements by consensus. Set-level performance was summarized as zero to four accurate images per four-image set. Image output from Common prompts was 2.7-fold more accurate than from Rare prompts (p < 0.05). Across platforms, overall accuracy was limited (highest accuracy score 52 percent; lowest 32 percent; mean 42 percent). All-correct (4 out of 4) outcomes were similar across platforms. By contrast, all-incorrect (0 out of 4) outcomes varied substantially, with Imagen 3 exhibiting the fewest failures and Microsoft Image Generator exhibiting the highest number of failures. Qualitative review of the image dataset identified recurring patterns including over-embellishment, confusion between medieval styles and their later revivals, and misrepresentation of descriptive prompts (for example, egg-and-dart, banded column, pendentive). These findings support the need for visible labeling of GenAI synthetic content, provenance standards for future training datasets, and cautious educational use of GenAI architectural imagery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e865\u4e2a\u4e3b\u6d41AI\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u5e73\u53f0\u5728\u5efa\u7b51\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6574\u4f53\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6709\u9650\uff08\u5e73\u574742%\uff09\uff0c\u5e38\u89c1\u63d0\u793a\u6bd4\u7f55\u89c1\u63d0\u793a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u9ad82.7\u500d\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u5e73\u53f0\u5728\u5b8c\u5168\u9519\u8bef\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0a\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5efa\u7b51\u9886\u57df\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5386\u53f2\u89c4\u5219\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u5efa\u7b51\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u51c6\u786e\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e86\u89e3\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e865\u4e2a\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684AI\u56fe\u50cf\u5e73\u53f0\uff08Adobe Firefly\u3001DALL-E 3\u3001Google Imagen 3\u3001Microsoft Image Generator\u3001Midjourney\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u752830\u4e2a\u6db5\u76d6\u4e0d\u540c\u98ce\u683c\u3001\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u89c4\u8303\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u5efa\u7b51\u63d0\u793a\u3002\u6bcf\u4e2a\u63d0\u793a-\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7ec4\u5408\u4ea7\u751f4\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\uff08\u5171600\u5f20\uff09\u3002\u4e24\u4f4d\u5efa\u7b51\u5386\u53f2\u5b66\u5bb6\u6839\u636e\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u6807\u51c6\u72ec\u7acb\u8bc4\u5206\u56fe\u50cf\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u8bc6\u89e3\u51b3\u5206\u6b67\u3002", "result": "\u5e38\u89c1\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u8f93\u51fa\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6bd4\u7f55\u89c1\u63d0\u793a\u9ad82.7\u500d\uff08p < 0.05\uff09\u3002\u5404\u5e73\u53f0\u6574\u4f53\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6709\u9650\uff08\u6700\u9ad852%\uff0c\u6700\u4f4e32%\uff0c\u5e73\u574742%\uff09\u3002\u5168\u6b63\u786e\u7ed3\u679c\uff084/4\uff09\u5728\u5404\u5e73\u53f0\u95f4\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u4f46\u5168\u9519\u8bef\u7ed3\u679c\uff080/4\uff09\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff0cImagen 3\u5931\u8d25\u6700\u5c11\uff0cMicrosoft Image Generator\u5931\u8d25\u6700\u591a\u3002\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\u91cd\u590d\u6a21\u5f0f\u5305\u62ec\u8fc7\u5ea6\u88c5\u9970\u3001\u4e2d\u4e16\u7eaa\u98ce\u683c\u4e0e\u540e\u671f\u590d\u5174\u98ce\u683c\u6df7\u6dc6\u3001\u63cf\u8ff0\u6027\u63d0\u793a\u8bef\u8bfb\u7b49\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u652f\u6301\u9700\u8981\u5bf9AI\u5408\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u89c1\u6807\u7b7e\u6807\u6ce8\u3001\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5efa\u7acb\u6765\u6e90\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u8c28\u614e\u4f7f\u7528AI\u5efa\u7b51\u56fe\u50cf\u3002AI\u5728\u5efa\u7b51\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4ecd\u6709\u5f85\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u7f55\u89c1\u6216\u4e13\u4e1a\u5efa\u7b51\u5143\u7d20\u65f6\u3002"}}

The proposed loss reshapes localization gradients by combining non monotonic focusing with decoupled width and height optimization, thereby enhancing weak regression signals for hard samples with low overlap while reducing gradient interference. This design is particularly effective for small and low contrast targets commonly observed in agricultural disease imagery. The proposed N EIoU loss is integrated into a lightweight YOLOv9t architecture and evaluated on a self collected field dataset comprising 5908 rice leaf images across four disease categories and healthy leaves. Experimental results demonstrate consistent performance gains over the standard CIoU loss, achieving a mean Average Precision of 90.3 percent, corresponding to a 4.3 percent improvement over the baseline, with improved localization accuracy under stricter evaluation criteria. For practical validation, the optimized model is deployed on an Android device using TensorFlow Lite with Float16 quantization, achieving an average inference time of 156 milliseconds per frame while maintaining accuracy.

We present a deployment-oriented framework that leverages knowledge distillation to translate a high-performing segmentation model into a scalable family of compact student models, without modifying the inference pipeline.

Traditional deep learning models either process frames independently, ignoring temporal information, or rely on memory-based feature propagation, which accumulates error over time. Methods: We propose Point-Seg, a transformer-based segmentation framework that integrates point tracking as a temporal cue to ensure stable and consistent segmentation of myocardium across frames. Our method leverages a point-tracking module trained on a synthetic echocardiography dataset to track key anatomical landmarks across video sequences. These tracked trajectories provide an explicit motion-aware signal that guides segmentation, reducing drift and eliminating the need for memory-based feature accumulation. Additionally, we incorporate a temporal smoothing loss to further enhance temporal consistency across frames. Results: We evaluate our approach on both public and private echocardiography datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that Point-Seg has statistically similar accuracy in terms of Dice to state-of-the-art segmentation models in high quality echo data, while it achieves better segmentation accuracy in lower quality echo with improved temporal stability. Furthermore, Point-Seg has the key advantage of pixel-level myocardium motion information as opposed to other segmentation methods. Such information is essential in the computation of other downstream tasks such as myocardial strain measurement and regional wall motion abnormality detection. Conclusion: Point-Seg demonstrates that point tracking can serve as an effective temporal cue for consistent video segmentation, offering a reliable and generalizable approach for myocardium segmentation in echocardiography videos.

A key challenge is transferring knowledge from NBI to enhance WLI-only models, yet existing methods are critically hampered by their reliance on paired NBI-WLI images of the same lesion, a costly and often impractical requirement that leaves vast amounts of clinical data untapped. In this paper, we break this paradigm by introducing PaGKD, a novel Pairing-free Group-level Knowledge Distillation framework that that enables effective cross-modal learning using unpaired WLI and NBI data. Instead of forcing alignment between individual, often semantically mismatched image instances, PaGKD operates at the group level to distill more complete and compatible knowledge across modalities. Central to PaGKD are two complementary modules: (1) Group-level Prototype Distillation (GKD-Pro) distills compact group representations by extracting modality-invariant semantic prototypes via shared lesion-aware queries; (2) Group-level Dense Distillation (GKD-Den) performs dense cross-modal alignment by guiding group-aware attention with activation-derived relation maps. Together, these modules enforce global semantic consistency and local structural coherence without requiring image-level correspondence. Extensive experiments on four clinical datasets demonstrate that PaGKD consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving relative AUC improvements of 3.3%, 1.1%, 2.8%, and 3.2%, respectively, establishing a new direction for cross-modal learning from unpaired data.", "AI": {"tldr": "PaGKD\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u914d\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u7ec4\u7ea7\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5229\u7528\u672a\u914d\u5bf9\u7684WLI\u548cNBI\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347WLI-only\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5185\u7aa5\u955c\u764c\u75c7\u7b5b\u67e5\u4e2d\uff0c\u7a84\u5e26\u6210\u50cf(NBI)\u6bd4\u767d\u5149\u6210\u50cf(WLI)\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u914d\u5bf9\u7684NBI-WLI\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5927\u91cf\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u65e0\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPaGKD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u6a21\u5757\uff1a1) GKD-Pro\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u75c5\u7076\u611f\u77e5\u67e5\u8be2\u63d0\u53d6\u6a21\u6001\u4e0d\u53d8\u8bed\u4e49\u539f\u578b\uff0c\u84b8\u998f\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u7ec4\u8868\u793a\uff1b2) GKD-Den\u901a\u8fc7\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6d3e\u751f\u5173\u7cfb\u56fe\u5f15\u5bfc\u7ec4\u611f\u77e5\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u6267\u884c\u5bc6\u96c6\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u4e24\u8005\u5171\u540c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u5c40\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPaGKD\u6301\u7eed\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5b9e\u73b03.3%\u30011.1%\u30012.8%\u548c3.2%\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9AUC\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "PaGKD\u6253\u7834\u4e86\u4f9d\u8d56\u914d\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ece\u672a\u914d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u8d44\u6e90\u3002"}}

We make three core contributions: generative multi-view reconstruction via sparse voxel fusion that extrapolates unseen geometry while maintaining constant token complexity, flow-based affordance grounding that captures inherent ambiguity in affordance distributions, and affordance-driven active view selection that leverages predicted affordances for intelligent viewpoint sampling.

Recent works attempt to address this with relaxed speculative decoding but lack theoretical grounding. In this paper, we establish the theoretical basis of relaxed SD and propose COOL-SD, an annealed relaxation of speculative decoding built on two key insights. The first analyzes the total variation (TV) distance between the target model and relaxed speculative decoding and yields an optimal resampling distribution that minimizes an upper bound of the distance.

However, due to low contrast and weak edge information in infrared images, it is challenging to extract discriminative object features for robust detection. To deal with this issue, we propose a novel vision-language representation learning paradigm for infrared object detection. An additional textual supervision with rich semantic information is explored to guide the disentanglement of object and non-object features. Specifically, we propose a Semantic Feature Alignment (SFA) module to align the object features with the corresponding text features. Furthermore, we develop an Object Feature Disentanglement (OFD) module that disentangles text-aligned object features and non-object features by minimizing their correlation. Finally, the disentangled object features are entered into the detection head. In this manner, the detection performance can be remarkably enhanced via more discriminative and less noisy features.

Establishing reliable correspondences requires descriptors that provide both high discriminative power and computational efficiency. To address this, we introduce Cross-Layer Independent Deformable Description (CLIDD), a method that achieves superior distinctiveness by sampling directly from independent feature hierarchies. This approach utilizes learnable offsets to capture fine-grained structural details across scales while bypassing the computational burden of unified dense representations. To ensure real-time performance, we implement a hardware-aware kernel fusion strategy that maximizes inference throughput. Furthermore, we develop a scalable framework that integrates lightweight architectures with a training protocol leveraging both metric learning and knowledge distillation. This scheme generates a wide spectrum of model variants optimized for diverse deployment constraints. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our approach achieves superior matching accuracy and exceptional computational efficiency simultaneously.

While recent works extend Gaussians with learnable textures to enrich visual appearance, existing approaches allocate a fixed square texture per primitive, leading to inefficient memory usage and limited adaptability to scene variability. In this paper, we introduce adaptive anisotropic textured Gaussians (A$^2$TG), a novel representation that generalizes textured Gaussians by equipping each primitive with an anisotropic texture. Our method employs a gradient-guided adaptive rule to jointly determine texture resolution and aspect ratio, enabling non-uniform, detail-aware allocation that aligns with the anisotropic nature of Gaussian splats. This design significantly improves texture efficiency, reducing memory consumption while enhancing image quality. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that A TG consistently outperforms fixed-texture Gaussian Splatting methods, achieving comparable rendering fidelity with substantially lower memory requirements.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u7eb9\u7406\u9ad8\u65af(A\u00b2TG)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u57fa\u5143\u914d\u5907\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u7eb9\u7406\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u68af\u5ea6\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u89c4\u5219\u786e\u5b9a\u7eb9\u7406\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u548c\u7eb5\u6a2a\u6bd4\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u7eb9\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9ad8\u65af\u6e85\u5c04\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u57fa\u5143\u5206\u914d\u56fa\u5b9a\u65b9\u5f62\u7eb9\u7406\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u573a\u666f\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7eb9\u7406\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6539\u5584\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u7eb9\u7406\u9ad8\u65af(A\u00b2TG)\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u57fa\u5143\u914d\u5907\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u7eb9\u7406\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u68af\u5ea6\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u89c4\u5219\u8054\u5408\u786e\u5b9a\u7eb9\u7406\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u548c\u7eb5\u6a2a\u6bd4\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u975e\u5747\u5300\u3001\u7ec6\u8282\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7eb9\u7406\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u4e0e\u9ad8\u65af\u6e85\u5c04\u7684\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u7279\u6027\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cA\u00b2TG\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u56fa\u5b9a\u7eb9\u7406\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u6e85\u5c04\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684\u6e32\u67d3\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u7eb9\u7406\u9ad8\u65af(A\u00b2TG)\u901a\u8fc7\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u7eb9\u7406\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7eb9\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6e32\u67d3\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u65af\u6e85\u5c04\u8868\u793a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7eb9\u7406\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While recent deep learning approaches achieve high accuracy when high-resolution multispectral data are available, their applicability in operational settings, where a quick delineation of the burn scar shortly after a wildfire incident is required, is limited by the trade-off between spatial resolution and temporal revisit frequency of current satellite systems. To address this limitation, we propose a novel deep learning model, namely BAM-MRCD, which employs multi-resolution, multi-source satellite imagery (MODIS and Sentinel-2) for the timely production of detailed burnt area maps with high spatial and temporal resolution. Our model manages to detect even small scale wildfires with high accuracy, surpassing similar change detection models as well as solid baselines.

Prior work has coupled physics simulation with Gaussians, but predominantly targets soft, deformable materials, leaving brittle fracture largely unresolved. This stems from two key obstacles: the lack of volumetric interiors with coherent textures in GS representation, and the absence of fracture-aware simulation methods for Gaussians. To address these challenges, we introduce GaussianFluent, a unified framework for realistic simulation and rendering of dynamic object states. First, it synthesizes photorealistic interiors by densifying internal Gaussians guided by generative models. Second, it integrates an optimized Continuum Damage Material Point Method (CD-MPM) to enable brittle fracture simulation at remarkably high speed. Our approach handles complex scenarios including mixed-material objects and multi-stage fracture propagation, achieving results infeasible with previous methods.

However, the knowledge is not only hidden in the textual modality but also in the image modality. Traditional methods can parse text from domain documents but dont have image captioning ability. Multi-modal LLM (MLLM) can understand images, but they do not have sufficient domain knowledge. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a multi-stage progressive training strategy to train a Domain-specific Image Captioning Model (DICModel) in ICT, and constructs a standard evaluation system to validate the performance of DICModel. Specifically, this work first synthesizes about 7K image-text pairs by combining the Mermaid tool and LLMs, which are used for the first-stage supervised-fine-tuning (SFT) of DICModel. Then, ICT-domain experts manually annotate about 2K image-text pairs for the second-stage SFT of DICModel. Finally, experts and LLMs jointly synthesize about 1.5K visual question answering data for the instruction-based SFT. Experimental results indicate that our DICModel with only 7B parameters performs better than other state-of-the-art models with 32B parameters. Compared to the SOTA models with 7B and 32B parameters, our DICModel increases the BLEU metric by approximately 56.8% and 20.8%, respectively. On the objective questions constructed by ICT domain experts, our DICModel outperforms Qwen2.5-VL 32B by 1% in terms of accuracy rate.

This is the authors' final accepted manuscript", "summary": "With advances in artificial intelligence, image processing has gained significant interest. Image super-resolution is a vital technology closely related to real-world applications, as it enhances the quality of existing images. Since enhancing fine details is crucial for the super-resolution task, pixels that contribute to high-frequency information should be emphasized. This paper proposes two methods to enhance high-frequency details in super-resolution images: a Laplacian pyramid-based detail loss and a repeated upscaling and downscaling process. Total loss with our detail loss guides a model by separately generating and controlling super-resolution and detail images. This approach allows the model to focus more effectively on high-frequency components, resulting in improved super-resolution images. Additionally, repeated upscaling and downscaling amplify the effectiveness of the detail loss by extracting diverse information from multiple low-resolution features. We conduct two types of experiments. First, we design a CNN-based model incorporating our methods. This model achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing all currently available CNN-based and even some attention-based models. Second, we apply our methods to existing attention-based models on a small scale. In all our experiments, attention-based models adding our detail loss show improvements compared to the originals. These results demonstrate our approaches effectively enhance super-resolution images across different model structures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u589e\u5f3a\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u9ad8\u9891\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u91d1\u5b57\u5854\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\u635f\u5931\u548c\u91cd\u590d\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bb\u751f\u6210\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u7ec6\u8282\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5173\u6ce8\u9ad8\u9891\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u5728CNN\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6280\u672f\u5bf9\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u800c\u589e\u5f3a\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7ec6\u8282\u662f\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u9ad8\u9891\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f3a\u8c03\u90a3\u4e9b\u8d21\u732e\u9ad8\u9891\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u50cf\u7d20\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u91d1\u5b57\u5854\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bb\u751f\u6210\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u7ec6\u8282\u56fe\u50cf\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\uff1b2\uff09\u91cd\u590d\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ece\u591a\u4e2a\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7279\u5f81\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u7ec6\u8282\u635f\u5931\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "1\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684CNN\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u6240\u6709\u73b0\u6709CNN\u6a21\u578b\u751a\u81f3\u90e8\u5206\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u578b\uff1b2\uff09\u5c06\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u6dfb\u52a0\u7ec6\u8282\u635f\u5931\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\u539f\u59cb\u7248\u672c\u90fd\u6709\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u9ad8\u9891\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Saeed", "Oliver Yu", "Simin Ni", "Jie Huang", "Yipeng Hu"], "title": "Radiomics-Integrated Deep Learning with Hierarchical Loss for Osteosarcoma Histology Classification", "comment": null, "summary": "Osteosarcoma (OS) is an aggressive primary bone malignancy. Accurate histopathological assessment of viable versus non-viable tumor regions after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is critical for prognosis and treatment planning, yet manual evaluation remains labor-intensive, subjective, and prone to inter-observer variability. Recent advances in digital pathology have enabled automated necrosis quantification. Evaluating on test data, independently sampled on patient-level, revealed that the deep learning model performance dropped significantly from the tile-level generalization ability reported in previous studies. First, this work proposes the use of radiomic features as additional input in model training. We show that, despite that they are derived from the images, such a multimodal input effectively improved the classification performance, in addition to its added benefits in interpretability. Second, this work proposes to optimize two binary classification tasks with hierarchical classes (i.e. tumor-vs-non-tumor and viable-vs-non-viable), as opposed to the alternative ``flat'' three-class classification task (i.e. non-tumor, non-viable tumor, viable tumor), thereby enabling a hierarchical loss. We show that such a hierarchical loss, with trainable weightings between the two tasks, the per-class performance can be improved significantly. Using the TCIA OS Tumor Assessment dataset, we experimentally demonstrate the benefits from each of the proposed new approaches and their combination, setting a what we consider new state-of-the-art performance on this open dataset for this application.

However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on single-step perception-to-judgment tasks, leaving scenarios requiring complex visual-spatial logical chains significantly underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce Video-MSR, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate Multi-hop Spatial Reasoning (MSR) in dynamic video scenarios. Video-MSR systematically probes MSR capabilities through four distinct tasks: Constrained Localization, Chain-based Reference Retrieval, Route Planning, and Counterfactual Physical Deduction. Our benchmark comprises 3,052 high-quality video instances with 4,993 question-answer pairs, constructed via a scalable, visually-grounded pipeline combining advanced model generation with rigorous human verification. Through a comprehensive evaluation of 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs, we uncover significant limitations, revealing that while models demonstrate proficiency in surface-level perception, they exhibit distinct performance drops in MSR tasks, frequently suffering from spatial disorientation and hallucination during multi-step deductions. To mitigate these shortcomings and empower models with stronger MSR capabilities, we further curate MSR-9K, a specialized instruction-tuning dataset, and fine-tune Qwen-VL, achieving a +7.82% absolute improvement on Video-MSR. Our results underscore the efficacy of multi-hop spatial instruction data and establish Video-MSR as a vital foundation for future research.

We study cross-dataset object detection (CD-OD) through a lens of setting specificity. We group benchmarks into setting-agnostic datasets with diverse everyday scenes and setting-specific datasets tied to a narrow environment, and evaluate a standard detector family across all train--test pairs. This reveals a clear structure in CD-OD: transfer within the same setting type is relatively stable, while transfer across setting types drops substantially and is often asymmetric. The most severe breakdowns occur when transferring from specific sources to agnostic targets, and persist after open-label alignment, indicating that domain shift dominates in the hardest regimes. To disentangle domain shift from label mismatch, we compare closed-label transfer with an open-label protocol that maps predicted classes to the nearest target label using CLIP similarity. Open-label evaluation yields consistent but bounded gains, and many corrected cases correspond to semantic near-misses supported by the image evidence. Overall, we provide a principled characterization of CD-OD under setting specificity and practical guidance for evaluating detectors under distribution shift.

While point maps assume static scenes, Dynamic Point Maps (DPMs) extend this concept to dynamic 3D content by additionally representing scene motion. However, existing DPMs are limited to image pairs and, like DUSt3R, require post processing via optimization when more than two views are involved. We argue that DPMs are more useful when applied to videos and introduce V-DPM to demonstrate this. First, we show how to formulate DPMs for video input in a way that maximizes representational power, facilitates neural prediction, and enables reuse of pretrained models. Second, we implement these ideas on top of VGGT, a recent and powerful 3D reconstructor. Although VGGT was trained on static scenes, we show that a modest amount of synthetic data is sufficient to adapt it into an effective V-DPM predictor. Our approach achieves state of the art performance in 3D and 4D reconstruction for dynamic scenes. In particular, unlike recent dynamic extensions of VGGT such as P3, DPMs recover not only dynamic depth but also the full 3D motion of every point in the scene.", "AI": {"tldr": "V-DPM\u5c06\u52a8\u6001\u70b9\u5730\u56fe\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u5728VGGT\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c11\u91cf\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u57283D/4D\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u52a8\u6001\u70b9\u5730\u56fe\uff08DPMs\uff09\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u5904\u7406\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u65f6\u9700\u8981\u540e\u5904\u7406\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3aDPMs\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u66f4\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63d0\u51faV-DPM\u6765\u6269\u5c55\u8fd9\u4e00\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "method": "1. \u5c06DPMs\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u5316\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u4fbf\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u9884\u6d4b\u5e76\u91cd\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff1b2. \u5728VGGT\uff08\u5f3a\u5927\u76843D\u91cd\u5efa\u5668\uff09\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c11\u91cf\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5c06\u5176\u9002\u5e94\u4e3a\u6709\u6548\u7684V-DPM\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u3002", "result": "V-DPM\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u76843D\u548c4D\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u4e0eVGGT\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6269\u5c55\uff08\u5982P3\uff09\u4e0d\u540c\uff0cDPMs\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u6062\u590d\u52a8\u6001\u6df1\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u6062\u590d\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6bcf\u4e2a\u70b9\u7684\u5b8c\u65743D\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002", "conclusion": "V-DPM\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u52a8\u6001\u70b9\u5730\u56fe\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u5728VGGT\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u901a\u8fc7\u5c11\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u9002\u5e94\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6062\u590d\u5b8c\u6574\u76843D\u8fd0\u52a8\u4fe1\u606f\u3002"}}

Deep generative models have been explored, but most rely solely on image intensity, leading to two key limitations: 1) the fidelity or trustworthiness of the generated brain images are limited, making downstream studies questionable; 2) the usage flexibility is restricted due to fixed guidance rooted in the model structure, restricting full ability to versatile application scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce DF-DiffCom, a Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN)-enhanced diffusion model that smartly leverages deformation fields for trustworthy longitudinal brain image completion. Trained on OASIS-3, DF-DiffCom outperforms state-of-the-art methods, improving PSNR by 5.6% and SSIM by 0.12.

Unlike previous methods, our method is training-free and does not introduce embeddings from a CLIP/BERT text encoder.

Commonly used methods evaluate Euclidean distances between point clouds and minimize an objective function, such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). However, these approaches are most effective when the point clouds are well-prealigned and issues such as differences in density, noise, holes, and limited overlap can compromise the results. Traditional methods, such as Iterative Closest Point (ICP), require choosing one point cloud as fixed, since Euclidean distances lack commutativity. When only one point cloud has issues, adjustments can be made, but in real scenarios, both point clouds may be affected, often necessitating preprocessing. The authors introduce a novel differential entropy-based metric, designed to serve as the objective function within an optimization framework for fine rigid pairwise 3D point cloud registration, denoted as Iterative Differential Entropy Minimization (IDEM). This metric does not depend on the choice of a fixed point cloud and, during transformations, reveals a clear minimum corresponding to the best alignment. Multiple case studies are conducted, and the results are compared with those obtained using RMSE, Chamfer distance, and Hausdorff distance. The proposed metric proves effective even with density differences, noise, holes, and partial overlap, where RMSE does not always yield optimal alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5fae\u5206\u71b5\u7684\u65b0\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5IDEM\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e3D\u70b9\u4e91\u914d\u51c6\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u5b54\u6d1e\u548c\u90e8\u5206\u91cd\u53e0\u65f6\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u70b9\u4e91\u914d\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982ICP\uff09\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6b27\u6c0f\u8ddd\u79bb\u5ea6\u91cf\uff08\u5982RMSE\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u5b54\u6d1e\u548c\u6709\u9650\u91cd\u53e0\u65f6\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u9009\u62e9\u56fa\u5b9a\u70b9\u4e91\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4ea4\u6362\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5fae\u5206\u71b5\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u79f0\u4e3a\u8fed\u4ee3\u5fae\u5206\u71b5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\uff08IDEM\uff09\u3002\u8be5\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u56fa\u5b9a\u70b9\u4e91\u7684\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5728\u53d8\u6362\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u80fd\u663e\u793a\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\u5bf9\u5e94\u6700\u4f73\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4e0eRMSE\u3001Chamfer\u8ddd\u79bb\u548cHausdorff\u8ddd\u79bb\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u5b54\u6d1e\u548c\u90e8\u5206\u91cd\u53e0\u65f6\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u800cRMSE\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5e76\u4e0d\u603b\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u4f18\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "conclusion": "IDEM\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u70b9\u4e91\u914d\u51c6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u5404\u79cd\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u56fa\u5b9a\u70b9\u4e91\u7684\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002"}}

While straightforward, this approach is sensitive to label noise and neglects whether one sample is more positive than another, resulting in unstable predictions and poor correlation alignment. Pairwise ordinal learning frameworks emerged to address this gap, capturing relative order by learning from comparisons. Yet, they introduce two new trade-offs: First, they assign uniform importance to all comparisons, failing to adaptively focus on hard-to-rank samples. Second, they employ static ranking margins, which fail to reflect the varying semantic distances between sentiment groups. To address this, we propose a Two-Stage Group-wise Ranking and Calibration Framework (GRCF) that adapts the philosophy of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our framework resolves these trade-offs by simultaneously preserving relative ordinal structure, ensuring absolute score calibration, and adaptively focusing on difficult samples. Specifically, Stage 1 introduces a GRPO-inspired Advantage-Weighted Dynamic Margin Ranking Loss to build a fine-grained ordinal structure. Stage 2 then employs an MAE-driven objective to align prediction magnitudes. To validate its generalizability, we extend GRCF to classification tasks, including multimodal humor detection and sarcasm detection.

However, most existing systems focus narrowly on object classification within fixed visual scopes and apply rule-based heuristics to determine intrusion status, often overlooking targets that pose latent intrusion risks. Anticipating such risks requires the cognition of spatial context and temporal dynamics for the object of interest (OOI), which presents challenges for conventional visual models. To facilitate deep intrusion perception, we introduce a novel benchmark, CogRail, which integrates curated open-source datasets with cognitively driven question-answer annotations to support spatio-temporal reasoning and prediction. Building upon this benchmark, we conduct a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art visual-language models (VLMs) using multimodal prompts to identify their strengths and limitations in this domain. Furthermore, we fine-tune VLMs for better performance and propose a joint fine-tuning framework that integrates three core tasks, position perception, movement prediction, and threat analysis, facilitating effective adaptation of general-purpose foundation models into specialized models tailored for cognitive intrusion perception. Extensive experiments reveal that current large-scale multimodal models struggle with the complex spatial-temporal reasoning required by the cognitive intrusion perception task, underscoring the limitations of existing foundation models in this safety-critical domain. In contrast, our proposed joint fine-tuning framework significantly enhances model performance by enabling targeted adaptation to domain-specific reasoning demands, highlighting the advantages of structured multi-task learning in improving both accuracy and interpretability.

We find that generations from each T2I model form distinctive clusters in the image embedding space, enabling accurate deanonymization without prompt control or training data. Using 22 models and 280 prompts (150K images), our centroid-based method achieves high accuracy and reveals systematic model-specific signatures. We further introduce a prompt-level distinguishability metric and conduct large-scale analyses showing how certain prompts can lead to near-perfect distinguishability.

Prior methods either require multi-view capture and expensive differentiable simulation or predict only garment geometry without the material properties required for realistic simulation. We propose a feed-forward framework that sidesteps these limitations by first fine-tuning a vision-language model to infer material composition and fabric attributes from real images, and then training a lightweight predictor that maps these attributes to the corresponding physical fabric parameters using a small dataset of material-physics measurements. Our approach introduces two new datasets (FTAG and T2P) and delivers simulation-ready garments from a single image without iterative optimization. Experiments show that our estimator achieves superior accuracy in material composition estimation and fabric attribute prediction, and by passing them through our physics parameter estimator, we further achieve higher-fidelity simulations compared to state-of-the-art image-to-garment methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ece\u5355\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u4f30\u8ba1\u7269\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u53ef\u6a21\u62df\u670d\u88c5\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u65ad\u6750\u6599\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u7ec7\u7269\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u518d\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u7269\u7406\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u6355\u83b7\u6216\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u6a21\u62df", "motivation": "\u4ece\u5355\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u4f30\u8ba1\u7269\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u53ef\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u670d\u88c5\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u7269\u7406\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e14\u95ee\u9898\u672c\u8eab\u662f\u75c5\u6001\u7684\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u9700\u8981\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u6355\u83b7\u548c\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u53ea\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u800c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6a21\u62df\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6750\u6599\u5c5e\u6027", "method": "1) \u5fae\u8c03\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u63a8\u65ad\u6750\u6599\u6210\u5206\u548c\u7ec7\u7269\u5c5e\u6027\uff1b2) \u8bad\u7ec3\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u5c06\u5c5e\u6027\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u7269\u7406\u7ec7\u7269\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5c0f\u578b\u6750\u6599-\u7269\u7406\u6d4b\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b3) \u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6(FTAG\u548cT2P)\uff1b4) \u65e0\u9700\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u5373\u53ef\u4ece\u5355\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u6a21\u62df\u670d\u88c5", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6750\u6599\u6210\u5206\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u7ec7\u7269\u5c5e\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u8fbe\u5230\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u670d\u88c5\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u6548\u679c", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u524d\u9988\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u5355\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u62df\u5c31\u7eea\u7684\u670d\u88c5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u6355\u83b7\u6216\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u5728\u6750\u6599\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u7269\u7406\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u7269\u7406\u670d\u88c5\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

To address this, we propose SCE-SLAM, an end-to-end SLAM system that maintains scale consistency through scene coordinate embeddings, which are learned patch-level representations encoding 3D geometric relationships under a canonical scale reference. The framework consists of two key modules: geometry-guided aggregation that leverages 3D spatial proximity to propagate scale information from historical observations through geometry-modulated attention, and scene coordinate bundle adjustment that anchors current estimates to the reference scale through explicit 3D coordinate constraints decoded from the scene coordinate embeddings.

This inefficiency poses a critical barrier to deploying generative video in applications that require real-time interactions, such as embodied AI and VR/AR. This paper explores a new strategy for camera-conditioned video generation of static scenes: using diffusion-based generative models to generate a sparse set of keyframes, and then synthesizing the full video through 3D reconstruction and rendering. By lifting keyframes into a 3D representation and rendering intermediate views, our approach amortizes the generation cost across hundreds of frames while enforcing geometric consistency. We further introduce a model that predicts the optimal number of keyframes for a given camera trajectory, allowing the system to adaptively allocate computation. Our final method, SRENDER, uses very sparse keyframes for simple trajectories and denser ones for complex camera motion. This results in video generation that is more than 40 times faster than the diffusion-based baseline in generating 20 seconds of video, while maintaining high visual fidelity and temporal stability, offering a practical path toward efficient and controllable video synthesis.", "AI": {"tldr": "SRENDER\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u7a00\u758f\u5173\u952e\u5e27+3D\u91cd\u5efa\u6e32\u67d3\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u6bd4\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u7ebf\u5feb40\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cfGPU\u65f6\u95f4\u751f\u6210\u77ed\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u8fd9\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u5728\u9700\u8981\u5b9e\u65f6\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff08\u5982\u5177\u8eabAI\u548cVR/AR\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u90e8\u7f72", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSRENDER\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u4f7f\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7a00\u758f\u5173\u952e\u5e27\uff1b2) \u5c06\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u63d0\u5347\u4e3a3D\u8868\u793a\uff1b3) \u901a\u8fc73D\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u6e32\u67d3\u5408\u6210\u5b8c\u6574\u89c6\u9891\uff1b4) \u5f15\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed9\u5b9a\u76f8\u673a\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u914d\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90", "result": "SRENDER\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u751f\u621020\u79d2\u89c6\u9891\u65f6\u6bd4\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u7ebf\u5feb40\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5e27\uff0c\u590d\u6742\u76f8\u673a\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5e27", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u6210\u672c\u5206\u644a\u5230\u6570\u767e\u5e27\u5e76\u5f3a\u5236\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0cSRENDER\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5408\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u573a\u666f\u7684\u76f8\u673a\u6761\u4ef6\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210"}}

Optimization-based methods typically follow a two-stage pipeline, first detecting 2D keypoints in each view and then associating these detections across views to triangulate the 3D pose. Existing methods rely on mere pairwise associations to model this correspondence problem, treating global consistency between views (i.e., cycle consistency) as a soft constraint. Yet, reconciling these constraints for multiple views becomes brittle when spurious associations propagate errors. We thus propose COMPOSE, a novel framework that formulates multi-view pose correspondence matching as a hypergraph partitioning problem rather than through pairwise association. While the complexity of the resulting integer linear program grows exponentially in theory, we introduce an efficient geometric pruning strategy to substantially reduce the search space.
