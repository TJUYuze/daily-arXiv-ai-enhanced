Recent works build robot foundation models by extending multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with action outputs, creating vision-language-action (VLA) systems. These efforts are motivated by the intuition that MLLMs' large-scale language and image pretraining can be effectively transferred to the action output modality. In this work, we explore an alternative paradigm of using large-scale video pretraining as a primary modality for building robot foundation models. Unlike static images and language, videos capture spatio-temporal sequences of states and actions in the physical world that are naturally aligned with robotic behavior. We curate an internet-scale video dataset of human activities and task demonstrations, and train, for the first time at a foundation-model scale, an open video model for generative robotics planning. The model produces zero-shot video plans for novel scenes and tasks, which we post-process to extract executable robot actions. We evaluate task-level generalization through third-party selected tasks in the wild and real-robot experiments, demonstrating successful physical execution. Together, these results show robust instruction following, strong generalization, and real-world feasibility. We release both the model and dataset to support open, reproducible video-based robot learning.

Soft robots pose unique modeling challenges due to their large nonlinear deformations, material incompressibility, and contact interactions, which complicate both numerical stability and physical accuracy. Despite recent progress, robotic simulators often struggle with modeling such phenomena in a scalable and application-relevant manner. We present SORS (Soft Over Rigid Simulator), a versatile, high-fidelity simulator designed to handle these complexities for soft robot applications. Our energy-based framework, built on the finite element method, allows modular extensions, enabling the inclusion of custom-designed material and actuation models. To ensure physically consistent contact handling, we integrate a constrained nonlinear optimization based on sequential quadratic programming, allowing for stable and accurate modeling of contact phenomena. We validate our simulator through a diverse set of real-world experiments, which include cantilever deflection, pressure-actuation of a soft robotic arm, and contact interactions from the PokeFlex dataset. In addition, we showcase the potential of our framework for control optimization of a soft robotic leg. These tests confirm that our simulator can capture both fundamental material behavior and complex actuation dynamics with high physical fidelity. By bridging the sim-to-real gap in these challenging domains, our approach provides a validated tool for prototyping next-generation soft robots, filling the gap of extensibility, fidelity, and usability in the soft robotic ecosystem.", "AI": {"tldr": "SORS\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u4eff\u771f\u5668\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6709\u9650\u5143\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea6\u675f\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u5904\u7406\u63a5\u89e6\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u771f\u5b9e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u7269\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u591a\u7269\u7406\u573a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u9700\u8981\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u6349\u4e0d\u540c\u6750\u6599\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5e76\u51c6\u786e\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u4eff\u771f\u5668\u5728\u5efa\u6a21\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u5927\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u53d8\u5f62\u3001\u6750\u6599\u4e0d\u53ef\u538b\u7f29\u6027\u548c\u63a5\u89e6\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u7269\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSORS\uff08Soft Over Rigid Simulator\uff09\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6709\u9650\u5143\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u53ef\u5305\u542b\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u6750\u6599\u548c\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e8f\u5217\u4e8c\u6b21\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u6765\u786e\u4fdd\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u63a5\u89e6\u5904\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u79cd\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4eff\u771f\u5668\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u60ac\u81c2\u6881\u504f\u8f6c\u3001\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u7684\u538b\u529b\u9a71\u52a8\u3001PokeFlex\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u63a5\u89e6\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u817f\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u4eff\u771f\u5668\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5730\u6355\u6349\u57fa\u672c\u6750\u6599\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u590d\u6742\u9a71\u52a8\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002", "conclusion": "SORS\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6311\u6218\u6027\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u5f25\u5408\u4eff\u771f\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e3a\u539f\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ecf\u8fc7\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3001\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002"}}

The environment of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) presents unique challenges when planning inspection operations that maximise visibility, information, and data quality. Specular reflection of sunlight from spacecraft bodies, self-shadowing, and dynamic lighting in LEO significantly impact the quality of data captured throughout an orbit. This is exacerbated by the relative motion between spacecraft, which introduces variable imaging distances and attitudes during inspection. Planning inspection trajectories with the aide of simulation is a common approach. However, the ability to design and optimise an inspection trajectory specifically to improve the resulting image quality in proximity operations remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present $\\partial$LITE, an end-to-end differentiable simulation pipeline for on-orbit inspection operations. We leverage state-of-the-art differentiable rendering tools and a custom orbit propagator to enable end-to-end optimisation of orbital parameters based on visual sensor data. $\\partial$LITE enables us to automatically design non-obvious trajectories, vastly improving the quality and usefulness of attained data. To our knowledge, our differentiable inspection-planning pipeline is the first of its kind and provides new insights into modern computational approaches to spacecraft mission planning.

While the traditional approach to capturing these evaluations is to conduct a user study, recent work has proposed utilizing machine learning instead. However, existing data-driven methods require large amounts of labeled data, which limits their use in practice. To address this gap, we propose leveraging the few-shot learning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve how well a robot can predict a user's perception of its performance, and study this idea experimentally in social navigation tasks. To this end, we extend the SEAN TOGETHER dataset with additional real-world human-robot navigation episodes and participant feedback. Using this augmented dataset, we evaluate the ability of several LLMs to predict human perceptions of robot performance from a small number of in-context examples, based on observed spatio-temporal cues of the robot and surrounding human motion. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can match or exceed the performance of traditional supervised learning models while requiring an order of magnitude fewer labeled instances. We further show that prediction performance can improve with more in-context examples, confirming the scalability of our approach. Additionally, we investigate what kind of sensor-based information an LLM relies on to make these inferences by conducting an ablation study on the input features considered for performance prediction. Finally, we explore the novel application of personalized examples for in-context learning, i.e., drawn from the same user being evaluated, finding that they further enhance prediction accuracy.

In addition to their superior depth-dose distribution, heavy ions provide notable biological benefits compared to protons. Specifically, at therapeutic energies, very heavy ions are expected to exhibit high relative biological effectiveness and a low oxygen enhancement ratio, making them potentially ideal for treating radioresistant tumors. Over fifty years ago, the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory started a clinical trial to treat cancer patients with particles ranging from helium to argon. However, treatments with ions of atomic number greater than 10 proved highly toxic to normal tissue. Most patients were ultimately treated with helium ions, whose biological effects closely resemble those of protons. In recent years, novel strategies have emerged that can reduce normal tissue toxicity in radiotherapy while preserving tumor control. These advancements open the possibility of revisiting the clinical use of heavier ions. In this paper, we propose that neon ions may serve as an effective modality for treating resistant, hypoxic tumors. Their associated toxicity may be mitigated by employing approaches such as ultra-high dose rate (FLASH) or spatially fractionated radiotherapy. Current plans and prospects for the clinical application of neon ions will be discussed.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u91cd\u79bb\u5b50\u653e\u7597\u4e2d\u6c16\u79bb\u5b50\u53ef\u80fd\u6210\u4e3a\u6cbb\u7597\u8010\u836f\u6027\u7f3a\u6c27\u80bf\u7624\u7684\u6709\u6548\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u6b63\u5e38\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6bd2\u6027", "motivation": "\u91cd\u79bb\u5b50\u76f8\u6bd4X\u5c04\u7ebf\u5728\u653e\u7597\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u7269\u7406\u548c\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u6cbb\u7597\u6297\u8f90\u5c04\u80bf\u7624\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u3002\u5386\u53f2\u4e0a\u91cd\u79bb\u5b50\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u56e0\u6b63\u5e38\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6bd2\u6027\u800c\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u4f46\u65b0\u6280\u672f\u53d1\u5c55\u4f7f\u5f97\u91cd\u65b0\u63a2\u7d22\u91cd\u79bb\u5b50\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u6210\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6c16\u79bb\u5b50\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6cbb\u7597\u8010\u836f\u6027\u7f3a\u6c27\u80bf\u7624\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8d85\u9ad8\u901f\u5242\u91cf\u7387\uff08FLASH\uff09\u6216\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5272\u653e\u7597\u7b49\u6280\u672f\u6765\u51cf\u8f7b\u5176\u6bd2\u6027", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u6c16\u79bb\u5b50\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u5f53\u524d\u8ba1\u5212\u548c\u524d\u666f\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5176\u53ef\u80fd\u6210\u4e3a\u6cbb\u7597\u6297\u8f90\u5c04\u80bf\u7624\u7684\u6709\u6548\u624b\u6bb5", "conclusion": "\u6c16\u79bb\u5b50\u7ed3\u5408\u73b0\u4ee3\u653e\u7597\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u80fd\u4e3a\u6cbb\u7597\u8010\u836f\u6027\u7f3a\u6c27\u80bf\u7624\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u503c\u5f97\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4e34\u5e8a\u63a2\u7d22"}}

For this task, we used custom built robots with a linear actuator (pistons) mounted on top of each robot. The system continuously monitors the payload's orientation and computes the required piston height of each robot to maintain the desired orientation of the payload. In this work, we propose an open loop controller coupled with a closed loop PID controller to achieve the goal. As our modelling makes no assumptions on the type of terrain, the system can work on any unknown and uneven terrains and inclinations. We showcase the efficacy of our proposed controller by testing it on various simulated environments with varied and complex terrains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8f7d\u8377\u8fd0\u8f93\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u4e0d\u5e73\u5766\u5730\u5f62\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u8f7d\u8377\u671f\u671b\u59ff\u6001\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5f00\u73af+\u95ed\u73afPID\u63a7\u5236\u5668", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u4e0d\u5e73\u5766\u5730\u5f62\u4e2d\u8fd0\u8f93\u8f7d\u8377\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8f7d\u8377\u671f\u671b\u59ff\u6001\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u5730\u5f62\u6709\u5047\u8bbe\u9650\u5236", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5e26\u7ebf\u6027\u6267\u884c\u5668\uff08\u6d3b\u585e\uff09\u7684\u81ea\u5236\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f00\u73af\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7ed3\u5408\u95ed\u73afPID\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u8fde\u7eed\u76d1\u6d4b\u8f7d\u8377\u59ff\u6001\u5e76\u8ba1\u7b97\u5404\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6240\u9700\u6d3b\u585e\u9ad8\u5ea6", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u672a\u77e5\u4e0d\u5e73\u5766\u5730\u5f62\u548c\u5761\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u62df\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5728\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8f7d\u8377\u8fd0\u8f93\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u671f\u671b\u59ff\u6001\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5404\u79cd\u590d\u6742\u672a\u77e5\u5730\u5f62"}}

Among these challenges, the non-stationarity of the EEG signal is a key problem as it leads to various changes in the signal. There are changes within a session, across sessions, and across individuals. Variations over time for a given individual must be carefully managed to improve the BCI performance, including its accuracy, reliability, and robustness over time. This review paper presents and discusses the causes of non-stationarity in the EEG signal, along with its consequences for BCI applications, including covariate shift. The paper reviews recent studies on covariate shift, focusing on methods for detecting and correcting this phenomenon.

Among the emerging candidates, $^{44}$Sc has attracted significant interest due to its favourable physical properties, including a half-life of $\\sim$4 hours, a pure $\u03b2^{+}$ emission profile, and the additional prompt $\u03b3$-emission that enables advanced triple-photon detection schemes. These characteristics make $^{44}$Sc particularly promising for highresolution imaging and novel quantitative methodologies. However, routine clinical and preclinical implementation requires a practical, sustainable, and cost-efficient production route. In this context, we propose a titanium-scandium radionuclide generator as an optimal solution. This study focuses on optimising the synthesis of the long-lived parent isotope, $^{44}$Ti ($T_{1/2}$ = 59.1 years), from which $^{44}$Sc can be selectively eluted in a chemically pure form when needed. An analysis of various production pathways was conducted, including proton and deuteron reactions on scandium, as well as $\u03b1$-particle and lithium-induced reactions on calcium, to determine the most efficient reaction parameters, target design, and expected yield. Furthermore, we identify some existing cyclotron facilities suitable for implementing this technology. Results indicate that efficient $^{44}$Ti production is achievable using proton beams in the 20-30 MeV range under extended irradiation conditions. The proposed generator system would enable routine and decentralised $^{44}$Sc supply. Its integration with the novel J-PET scanner may significantly reduce diagnostic costs and improve access to advanced PET imaging in regions with limited medical imaging infrastructure.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u949b-\u94aa\u653e\u5c04\u6027\u6838\u7d20\u53d1\u751f\u5668\u4f5c\u4e3a\u751f\u4ea7\u2074\u2074Sc\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u2074\u2074Ti\u7684\u5408\u6210\u8def\u7ebf\uff0c\u4e3aPET\u548c\u6b63\u7535\u5b50\u7d20\u6210\u50cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u2074\u2074Sc\u4f9b\u5e94\u3002", "motivation": "\u2074\u2074Sc\u56e0\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u7269\u7406\u7279\u6027\uff08\u534a\u8870\u671f\u7ea64\u5c0f\u65f6\u3001\u7eaf\u03b2\u207a\u53d1\u5c04\u3001\u9644\u52a0\u77ac\u53d1\u03b3\u53d1\u5c04\uff09\u5728PET\u6210\u50cf\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u5b9e\u7528\u3001\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u9ad8\u7684\u751f\u4ea7\u9014\u5f84\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e34\u5e8a\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u524d\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4f18\u5316\u957f\u5bff\u547d\u6bcd\u4f53\u540c\u4f4d\u7d20\u2074\u2074Ti\uff08\u534a\u8870\u671f59.1\u5e74\uff09\u7684\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u591a\u79cd\u751f\u4ea7\u9014\u5f84\uff1a\u8d28\u5b50/\u6c18\u6838\u8f70\u51fb\u94aa\u3001\u03b1\u7c92\u5b50/\u9502\u8bf1\u5bfc\u53cd\u5e94\u8f70\u51fb\u9499\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u6700\u4f73\u53cd\u5e94\u53c2\u6570\u3001\u9776\u6750\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u9884\u671f\u4ea7\u989d\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u9002\u5408\u5b9e\u65bd\u8be5\u6280\u672f\u7684\u73b0\u6709\u56de\u65cb\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u8bbe\u65bd\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u572820-30 MeV\u8d28\u5b50\u675f\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u8f90\u7167\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u2074\u2074Ti\u751f\u4ea7\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u53d1\u751f\u5668\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u2074\u2074Sc\u7684\u5e38\u89c4\u5316\u548c\u5206\u6563\u5316\u4f9b\u5e94\uff0c\u4e0e\u65b0\u578bJ-PET\u626b\u63cf\u4eea\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8bca\u65ad\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u949b-\u94aa\u653e\u5c04\u6027\u6838\u7d20\u53d1\u751f\u5668\u662f\u2074\u2074Sc\u751f\u4ea7\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4fc3\u8fdb\u2074\u2074Sc\u5728PET\u6210\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u533b\u7597\u5f71\u50cf\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u6709\u9650\u7684\u5730\u533a\u6539\u5584\u5148\u8fdbPET\u6210\u50cf\u7684\u53ef\u53ca\u6027\u3002"}}

This limitation can be attributed to the fact that MLLMs learn visual understanding primarily from textual descriptions, which constitute a subjective and inherently incomplete supervisory signal. Furthermore, the modest scale of multimodal instruction tuning compared to massive text-only pre-training leads MLLMs to overfit language priors while overlooking visual details. To address these issues, we introduce JARVIS, a JEPA-inspired framework for self-supervised visual enhancement in MLLMs. Specifically, we integrate the I-JEPA learning paradigm into the standard vision-language alignment pipeline of MLLMs training. Our approach leverages frozen vision foundation models as context and target encoders, while training the predictor, implemented as the early layers of an LLM, to learn structural and semantic regularities from images without relying exclusively on language supervision. Extensive experiments on standard MLLM benchmarks show that JARVIS consistently improves performance on vision-centric benchmarks across different LLM families, without degrading multimodal reasoning abilities.

We propose SWIFT-Nav: Stability-aware Waypoint-level Integration of Fuzzy arbitration and TD3 for Navigation, a TD3-based navigation framework that achieves fast, stable convergence to obstacle-aware paths. The system couples a sensor-driven perception front end with a TD3 waypoint policy: the perception module converts LiDAR ranges into a confidence-weighted safety map and goal cues, while the TD3 policy is trained with Prioritised Experience Replay to focus on high-error transitions and a decaying epsilon-greedy exploration schedule that gradually shifts from exploration to exploitation. A lightweight fuzzy-logic layer computes a safety score from radial measurements and near obstacles, gates mode switching and clamps unsafe actions; in parallel, task-aligned reward shaping combining goal progress, clearance, and switch-economy terms provides dense, well-scaled feedback that accelerates learning. Implemented in Webots with proximity-based collision checking, our approach consistently outperforms baselines in trajectory smoothness and generalization to unseen layouts, while preserving real-time responsiveness.

In this paper, we explore the process of building high-quality heteroscedastic noise models. Our methods produce realistic synthesized noisy images, in both RAW and TIFF formats. Our synthesized noisy images achieve comparable LPIPS results to real noisy images, and greatly outperform those created with manufacturer-provided DNG noise models both in LPIPS and when tested with a state-of-the-art (SOTA) denoising model. Using our approach, we created the Synthesized Noisy Images using Calibration dataset (SNIC) containing over 6000 noisy images, comprising 30 scenes from four sensors, including two smartphone sensors, a point-and-shoot, and a DSLR.

The purpose of RM is to measure the Bragg peak (BP) position for each contributing beam, and detect any changes. Currently, there is no consensus on a clinical RM method, the use of which would improve the safety and consistency of treatment. The prototype filtered IVI (fIVI) Range Monitoring System is the first system to apply large-area and high-rate-capable silicon detectors to IVI. Two layers of these detectors track prompt secondary fragments for use in RM. This device monitored 16 cm and 32 cm diameter cylindrical plastic phantoms irradiated by clinical carbon ion beams at the Heidelberg Ion Beam Therapy Center. Approximately 20 different BP depths were delivered to each phantom, with a minimum depth difference of 0.8 mm and a maximum depth difference of 51.9 mm and 82.5 mm respectively. For large BP range differences, the relationship between the true depth difference and that measured by fIVI is quadratic, although for small differences, the deviation from a linear relationship with a slope of 1 is negligible. RM performance is strongly dependent on the number of tracked particles, particularly in the clinically-relevant regime. Significant performance differences exist between the two phantoms, with millimetric precision at clinical doses being achieved only for the 16 cm phantom. The performance achieved by the prototype fIVI Range Monitoring System is consistent with previous investigations of IVI, despite measuring at more challenging shallow BP positions. Further significant improvements are possible through increasing the sensitive area of the tracking system beyond the prototype, which will both allow an improvement in precision for the most intense points of a scanned treatment plan and expand the number of points for which millimetric precision may be achieved.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5f0f\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u9876\u70b9\u6210\u50cf\u7cfb\u7edf\u7528\u4e8e\u78b3\u79bb\u5b50\u653e\u7597\u4e2d\u7684\u5c04\u7a0b\u76d1\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7845\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6b21\u7ea7\u788e\u7247\u6765\u6d4b\u91cf\u5e03\u62c9\u683c\u5cf0\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u572816\u5398\u7c73\u4f53\u6a21\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6beb\u7c73\u7ea7\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\u4e34\u5e8a\u5c04\u7a0b\u76d1\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5171\u8bc6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u6cbb\u7597\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u76d1\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5f0f\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u9876\u70b9\u6210\u50cf\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u9762\u79ef\u9ad8\u8ba1\u6570\u7387\u7845\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u539f\u578b\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5f0f\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u9876\u70b9\u6210\u50cf\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u5c42\u5927\u9762\u79ef\u9ad8\u8ba1\u6570\u7387\u7845\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6b21\u7ea7\u788e\u7247\u3002\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u78b3\u79bb\u5b50\u675f\u7167\u5c04\u4e0b\u76d1\u6d4b16\u5398\u7c73\u548c32\u5398\u7c73\u76f4\u5f84\u5706\u67f1\u5851\u6599\u4f53\u6a21\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7ea620\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u5e03\u62c9\u683c\u5cf0\u6df1\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5927\u5c04\u7a0b\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u771f\u5b9e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5dee\u4e0e\u6d4b\u91cf\u503c\u5448\u4e8c\u6b21\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u5c0f\u5dee\u5f02\u65f6\u4e0e\u659c\u7387\u4e3a1\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\u504f\u5dee\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u300216\u5398\u7c73\u4f53\u6a21\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u5242\u91cf\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230\u6beb\u7c73\u7ea7\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c32\u5398\u7c73\u4f53\u6a21\u6027\u80fd\u8f83\u5dee\u3002\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7c92\u5b50\u6570\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u539f\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u66f4\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u6d45\u5c42\u5e03\u62c9\u683c\u5cf0\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e5f\u80fd\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u52a0\u63a2\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7075\u654f\u9762\u79ef\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u626b\u63cf\u6cbb\u7597\u8ba1\u5212\u4e2d\u6700\u5f3a\u70b9\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5e76\u6269\u5927\u6beb\u7c73\u7ea7\u7cbe\u5ea6\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u7684\u70b9\u6570\u8303\u56f4\u3002"}}

However, current evaluation benchmarks remain predominantly language-centric or heavily reliant on simulated environments, rarely probing the nuanced, knowledge-intensive reasoning essential for practical, real-world scenarios. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce the task of Sparsely Grounded Visual Navigation, explicitly designed to evaluate the sequential decision-making abilities of MLLMs in challenging, knowledge-intensive real-world environments. We operationalize this task with CityNav, a comprehensive benchmark encompassing four diverse global cities, specifically constructed to assess raw MLLM-driven agents in city navigation. Agents are required to rely solely on visual inputs and internal multimodal reasoning to sequentially navigate 50+ decision points without additional environmental annotations or specialized architectural modifications. Crucially, agents must autonomously achieve localization through interpreting city-specific cues and recognizing landmarks, perform spatial reasoning, and strategically plan and execute routes to their destinations. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that current state-of-the-art MLLMs and standard reasoning techniques (e.g., Chain-of-Thought, Reflection) significantly underperform in this challenging setting. To address this, we propose Verbalization of Path (VoP), which explicitly grounds the agent's internal reasoning by probing an explicit cognitive map (key landmarks and directions toward the destination) from the MLLMs, substantially enhancing navigation success.

However, their deployment requires generating feasible motions while jointly optimizing morphology and mounted pose under kinematic, dynamic, and physical constraints. Moreover, traditional single-branch designs often extend reach by increasing link length, which can easily violate torque limits at the base joint. To address these challenges, we propose a unified task-driven computational framework that integrates trajectory planning across varying morphologies with the co-optimization of morphology and mounted pose. Within this framework, a hierarchical model predictive control (HMPC) strategy is developed to enable motion planning for both redundant and non-redundant manipulators. For design optimization, the CMA-ES is employed to efficiently explore a hybrid search space consisting of discrete morphology configurations and continuous mounted poses. Meanwhile, a virtual module abstraction is introduced to enable bi-branch morphologies, allowing an auxiliary branch to offload torque from the primary branch and extend the achievable workspace without increasing the capacity of individual joint modules. Extensive simulations and hardware experiments on polishing, drilling, and pick-and-place tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The results show that: 1) the framework can generate multiple feasible designs that satisfy kinematic and dynamic constraints while avoiding environmental collisions for given tasks; 2) flexible design objectives, such as maximizing manipulability, minimizing joint effort, or reducing the number of modules, can be achieved by customizing the cost functions; and 3) a bi-branch morphology capable of operating in a large workspace can be realized without requiring more powerful basic modules.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u4efb\u52a1\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u5f62\u6001-\u5b89\u88c5\u4f4d\u59ff\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u91c7\u7528HMPC\u8fdb\u884c\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\uff0cCMA-ES\u8fdb\u884c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u865a\u62df\u6a21\u5757\u62bd\u8c61\u652f\u6301\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u5f62\u6001\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u5de5\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4", "motivation": "\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u90e8\u7f72\u9700\u8981\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u884c\u8fd0\u52a8\u5e76\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u5f62\u6001\u548c\u5b89\u88c5\u4f4d\u59ff\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5355\u5206\u652f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u52a0\u8fde\u6746\u957f\u5ea6\u6269\u5c55\u53ef\u8fbe\u8303\u56f4\u5bb9\u6613\u8fdd\u53cd\u57fa\u5173\u8282\u626d\u77e9\u9650\u5236", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u4efb\u52a1\u9a71\u52a8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u5f62\u6001-\u5b89\u88c5\u4f4d\u59ff\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236(HMPC)\u8fdb\u884c\u5197\u4f59\u548c\u975e\u5197\u4f59\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528CMA-ES\u7b97\u6cd5\u63a2\u7d22\u79bb\u6563\u5f62\u6001\u914d\u7f6e\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u5b89\u88c5\u4f4d\u59ff\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u865a\u62df\u6a21\u5757\u62bd\u8c61\u5b9e\u73b0\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u5f62\u6001", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff08\u629b\u5149\u3001\u94bb\u5b54\u3001\u62fe\u653e\u4efb\u52a1\uff09\u8868\u660e\uff1a1\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u4e3a\u7ed9\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u751f\u6210\u591a\u4e2a\u6ee1\u8db3\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u548c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7ea6\u675f\u4e14\u907f\u514d\u73af\u5883\u78b0\u649e\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff1b2\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u5236\u6210\u672c\u51fd\u6570\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7075\u6d3b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u76ee\u6807\uff08\u6700\u5927\u5316\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u3001\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5173\u8282\u52aa\u529b\u3001\u51cf\u5c11\u6a21\u5757\u6570\u91cf\uff09\uff1b3\uff09\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u5f62\u6001\u53ef\u5728\u4e0d\u8981\u6c42\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5927\u5de5\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u64cd\u4f5c", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u3001\u5f62\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u5b89\u88c5\u4f4d\u59ff\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u6269\u5c55\u5de5\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u800c\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u5355\u4e2a\u5173\u8282\u6a21\u5757\u5bb9\u91cf"}}

The growing number of similar in functionality models raises the challenge of evaluating them on datasets that do not contain ground truth annotations. We introduce a practical framework to assist in this task. Approach We harmonize the segmentation results into a standard, interoperable representation, which enables consistent, terminology-based labeling of the structures. We extend 3D Slicer to streamline loading and comparison of these harmonized segmentations, and demonstrate how standard representation simplifies review of the results using interactive summary plots and browser-based visualization using OHIF Viewer. To demonstrate the utility of the approach we apply it to evaluating segmentation of 31 anatomical structures (lungs, vertebrae, ribs, and heart) by six open-source models - TotalSegmentator 1.5 and 2.6, Auto3DSeg, MOOSE, MultiTalent, and CADS - for a sample of Computed Tomography (CT) scans from the publicly available National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) dataset. Results We demonstrate the utility of the framework in enabling automating loading, structure-wise inspection and comparison across models. Preliminary results ascertain practical utility of the approach in allowing quick detection and review of problematic results. The comparison shows excellent agreement segmenting some (e.g., lung) but not all structures (e.g., some models produce invalid vertebrae or rib segmentations).

Online range monitoring, which provides feedback during beam delivery, is particularly desirable, creating an opportunity to detect range errors before the treatment fraction is completed. Incorporating online range monitoring into clinical workflows may therefore improve the safety and consistency of radiotherapy.\n  Approach\n  The data analysis system was broken into a task-parallel pipeline approach, to allow multiple analysis stages to occur concurrently, beginning during acquisition. Computationally-expensive operations were further parallelized to reduce bottleneck effects. Data collected from irradiation of homogeneous plastic phantoms was replayed at the same rate it was initially acquired, to mimic data acquisition, and the time required to determine a range shift was measured.\n  Main Results\n  With an optimized pipeline, the delay between the end of irradiation and the determination of a range shift is consistently less than 200 ms. The majority of this time is associated with the final range shift determination, with a minor effect from the time required to analyze the last data packet. The most significant contribution to an optimized analysis workflow is the formation of clusters, requiring almost 50% of compute time.\n  Significance\n  This system is the first IVI implementation to achieve clinically-relevant online analysis times. The 200 ms time required to determine a range shift is less than the time required to accelerate a new spill in a synchrotron, and is comparable to the time required for reacceleration if multiple energies are delivered in the same spill. Clinical implementation of online range monitoring would allow treatment to be quickly paused or aborted if significant range errors are detected.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u78b3\u79bb\u5b50\u653e\u7597\u4e2d\u5728\u7ebf\u8303\u56f4\u76d1\u6d4b\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u9876\u70b9\u6210\u50cf\uff08IVI\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4efb\u52a1\u5e76\u884c\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u5206\u6790\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u81f3200\u6beb\u79d2\u4ee5\u4e0b\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e34\u5e8a\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u5206\u6790\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u78b3\u79bb\u5b50\u653e\u7597\u4e2d\u7684\u8303\u56f4\u76d1\u6d4b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u786e\u4fdd\u6cbb\u7597\u7cbe\u5ea6\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u5728\u7ebf\u8303\u56f4\u76d1\u6d4b\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u675f\u6d41\u8f93\u9001\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u65f6\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u5728\u6cbb\u7597\u5206\u6b21\u5b8c\u6210\u524d\u68c0\u6d4b\u8303\u56f4\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u653e\u7597\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u65f6\u95f4\u8f83\u957f\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u6d4b\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u5e76\u884c\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5c06\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u591a\u4e2a\u5e76\u884c\u5904\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u4ece\u91c7\u96c6\u5f00\u59cb\u5c31\u540c\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5bf9\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u64cd\u4f5c\u8fdb\u884c\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u74f6\u9888\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u5747\u8d28\u5851\u6599\u4f53\u6a21\u7684\u8f90\u7167\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e0e\u521d\u59cb\u91c7\u96c6\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u901f\u7387\u56de\u653e\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u786e\u5b9a\u8303\u56f4\u504f\u79fb\u6240\u9700\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u7684\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u8f90\u7167\u7ed3\u675f\u4e0e\u8303\u56f4\u504f\u79fb\u786e\u5b9a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u59cb\u7ec8\u5c0f\u4e8e200\u6beb\u79d2\u3002\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u65f6\u95f4\u6d88\u8017\u5728\u6700\u7ec8\u8303\u56f4\u504f\u79fb\u786e\u5b9a\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u5305\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u65f6\u95f4\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5c0f\u3002\u6700\u8017\u65f6\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u64cd\u4f5c\u662f\u7c07\u5f62\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5360\u7528\u4e86\u8fd150%\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e34\u5e8a\u76f8\u5173\u5728\u7ebf\u5206\u6790\u65f6\u95f4\u7684IVI\u5b9e\u65bd\u65b9\u6848\u3002200\u6beb\u79d2\u7684\u5206\u6790\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5c0f\u4e8e\u540c\u6b65\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u4ea7\u751f\u65b0\u675f\u6d41\u6240\u9700\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u4e0e\u540c\u4e00\u675f\u6d41\u4e2d\u591a\u80fd\u91cf\u8f93\u9001\u7684\u518d\u52a0\u901f\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u5f53\u3002\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u65bd\u5728\u7ebf\u8303\u56f4\u76d1\u6d4b\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u663e\u8457\u8303\u56f4\u8bef\u5dee\u65f6\u5feb\u901f\u6682\u505c\u6216\u4e2d\u6b62\u6cbb\u7597\u3002"}}

These multimodal memories enable them to recall past events, infer unobserved states, and integrate new information into context-dependent reasoning. Inspired by this capability, we introduce R4, a training-free framework for retrieval-augmented reasoning in 4D spatio-temporal space that equips vision-language models (VLMs) with structured, lifelong memory. R4 continuously constructs a 4D knowledge database by anchoring object-level semantic descriptions in metric space and time, yielding a persistent world model that can be shared across agents. At inference, natural language queries are decomposed into semantic, spatial, and temporal keys to retrieve relevant observations, which are integrated into the VLM's reasoning. Unlike classical retrieval-augmented generation methods, retrieval in R4 operates directly in 4D space, enabling episodic and collaborative reasoning without training. Experiments on embodied question answering and navigation benchmarks demonstrate that R4 substantially improves retrieval and reasoning over spatio-temporal information compared to baselines, advancing a new paradigm for embodied 4D reasoning in dynamic environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "R4\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u56db\u7ef4\u65f6\u7a7a\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u7ec8\u8eab\u8bb0\u5fc6\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa4D\u77e5\u8bc6\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u6765\u652f\u6301\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5177\u8eab\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u6301\u4e45\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\u6765\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u7406\u89e3\u56db\u7ef4\u73af\u5883\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8d4b\u4e88\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bb0\u5fc6\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u591f\u56de\u5fc6\u8fc7\u53bb\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3001\u63a8\u65ad\u672a\u89c2\u5bdf\u72b6\u6001\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u76f8\u5173\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "method": "R4\u6846\u67b6\u6301\u7eed\u6784\u5efa4D\u77e5\u8bc6\u6570\u636e\u5e93\uff0c\u5c06\u7269\u4f53\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u63cf\u8ff0\u951a\u5b9a\u5728\u5ea6\u91cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u6301\u4e45\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5c06\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u67e5\u8be2\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u952e\u6765\u68c0\u7d22\u76f8\u5173\u89c2\u5bdf\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u6574\u5408\u5230\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5177\u8eab\u95ee\u7b54\u548c\u5bfc\u822a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cR4\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65f6\u7a7a\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u60c5\u666f\u5f0f\u548c\u534f\u4f5c\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "R4\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5177\u8eab4D\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7ec8\u8eab\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65f6\u7a7a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

To ensure its reliability, it is crucial to accurately replicate interactions between AVs and background traffic, which necessitates effective calibration. However, existing calibration methods often fall short in achieving this goal. To address this gap, this study introduces a simulation platform calibration method that ensures high accuracy at both the vehicle and traffic flow levels. The method offers several key features:(1) with the capability of calibration for vehicle-to-vehicle interaction; (2) with accuracy assurance; (3) with enhanced efficiency; (4) with pipeline calibration capability. The proposed method is benchmarked against a baseline with no calibration and a state-of-the-art calibration method.

In practice, most model families scale language component while reusing nearly identical vision encoders (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL 3B/7B/72B), which raises pivotal concerns about whether progress reflects genuine visual grounding or reliance on internet-scale textual world knowledge. Existing evaluation methods emphasize end-task accuracy, overlooking robustness, attribution fidelity, and reasoning under controlled perturbations. We present The Perceptual Observatory, a framework that characterizes MLLMs across verticals like: (i) simple vision tasks, such as face matching and text-in-vision comprehension capabilities; (ii) local-to-global understanding, encompassing image matching, grid pointing game, and attribute localization, which tests general visual grounding. Each vertical is instantiated with ground-truth datasets of faces and words, systematically perturbed through pixel-based augmentations and diffusion-based stylized illusions. The Perceptual Observatory moves beyond leaderboard accuracy to yield insights into how MLLMs preserve perceptual grounding and relational structure under perturbations, providing a principled foundation for analyzing strengths and weaknesses of current and future models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\"\u611f\u77e5\u89c2\u6d4b\u7ad9\"\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u7aef\u4efb\u52a1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5173\u6ce8\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u5f52\u56e0\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u529f\u80fd\u5f3a\u5927\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u5927\u591a\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u8bed\u8a00\u7ec4\u4ef6\u65f6\u91cd\u590d\u4f7f\u7528\u51e0\u4e4e\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u8fd9\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\u662f\u771f\u6b63\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u8fd8\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u6587\u672c\u4e16\u754c\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fc7\u4e8e\u5f3a\u8c03\u7aef\u4efb\u52a1\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u5f52\u56e0\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u53d7\u63a7\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\"\u611f\u77e5\u89c2\u6d4b\u7ad9\"\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece\u591a\u4e2a\u5782\u76f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30MLLMs\uff1a1)\u7b80\u5355\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u4eba\u8138\u5339\u914d\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u6587\u672c\u7406\u89e3\uff09\uff1b2)\u5c40\u90e8\u5230\u5168\u5c40\u7406\u89e3\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u56fe\u50cf\u5339\u914d\u3001\u7f51\u683c\u6307\u5411\u6e38\u620f\u548c\u5c5e\u6027\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff09\u3002\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u90fd\u4f7f\u7528\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u4eba\u8138\u548c\u6587\u5b57\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u50cf\u7d20\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u5316\u5e7b\u89c9\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6270\u52a8\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u6392\u884c\u699c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790MLLMs\u5728\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u5982\u4f55\u4fdd\u6301\u611f\u77e5\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u5f53\u524d\u548c\u672a\u6765\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u548c\u52a3\u52bf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u6027\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "\"\u611f\u77e5\u89c2\u6d4b\u7ad9\"\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u63ed\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u7406\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u6b65\u7684\u672c\u8d28\u662f\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u8fd8\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u6587\u672c\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002"}}

However, current OSIL methods are primarily limited to short-horizon tasks, thus limiting their applicability to complex, long-horizon manipulations. To address this limitation, we propose ManiLong-Shot, a novel framework that enables effective OSIL for long-horizon prehensile manipulation tasks. ManiLong-Shot structures long-horizon tasks around physical interaction events, reframing the problem as sequencing interaction-aware primitives instead of directly imitating continuous trajectories. This primitive decomposition can be driven by high-level reasoning from a vision-language model (VLM) or by rule-based heuristics derived from robot state changes. For each primitive, ManiLong-Shot predicts invariant regions critical to the interaction, establishes correspondences between the demonstration and the current observation, and computes the target end-effector pose, enabling effective task execution. Extensive simulation experiments show that ManiLong-Shot, trained on only 10 short-horizon tasks, generalizes to 20 unseen long-horizon tasks across three difficulty levels via one-shot imitation, achieving a 22.8% relative improvement over the SOTA. Additionally, real-robot experiments validate ManiLong-Shot's ability to robustly execute three long-horizon manipulation tasks via OSIL, confirming its practical applicability.", "AI": {"tldr": "ManiLong-Shot\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u9884\u6293\u53d6\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5206\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e3a\u4ea4\u4e92\u611f\u77e5\u57fa\u5143\uff0c\u5728\u4ec5\u752810\u4e2a\u77ed\u89c6\u91ce\u4efb\u52a1\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\uff0c\u80fd\u6cdb\u5316\u523020\u4e2a\u672a\u89c1\u7684\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u534722.8%\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u77ed\u89c6\u91ce\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u9884\u6293\u53d6\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6709\u6548\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "ManiLong-Shot\u5c06\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u4efb\u52a1\u56f4\u7ed5\u7269\u7406\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e8b\u4ef6\u8fdb\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\uff0c\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u4ea4\u4e92\u611f\u77e5\u57fa\u5143\u800c\u975e\u76f4\u63a5\u6a21\u4eff\u8fde\u7eed\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002\u57fa\u5143\u5206\u89e3\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u5c42\u63a8\u7406\u6216\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u72b6\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u89c4\u5219\u9a71\u52a8\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6bcf\u4e2a\u57fa\u5143\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u4ea4\u4e92\u5173\u952e\u7684\u4e0d\u53d8\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u6f14\u793a\u4e0e\u5f53\u524d\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba1\u7b97\u76ee\u6807\u672b\u7aef\u6267\u884c\u5668\u4f4d\u59ff\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4ec5\u752810\u4e2a\u77ed\u89c6\u91ce\u4efb\u52a1\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\uff0cManiLong-Shot\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u6a21\u4eff\u6cdb\u5316\u523020\u4e2a\u672a\u89c1\u7684\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8de8\u8d8a\u4e09\u4e2a\u96be\u5ea6\u7ea7\u522b\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8622.8%\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u6539\u8fdb\u3002\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u6a21\u4eff\u9c81\u68d2\u5730\u6267\u884c\u4e09\u4e2a\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "ManiLong-Shot\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4ea4\u4e92\u611f\u77e5\u57fa\u5143\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u9884\u6293\u53d6\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

While prior research primarily focuses on predicting actions in single-human scenarios from an egocentric view, several robotic applications require understanding multiple human behaviors from a third-person perspective. To this end, we present CAMP-VLM (Context-Aware Multi-human behavior Prediction): a Vision Language Model (VLM)-based framework that incorporates contextual features from visual input and spatial awareness from scene graphs to enhance prediction of humans-scene interactions. Due to the lack of suitable datasets for multi-human behavior prediction from an observer view, we perform fine-tuning of CAMP-VLM with synthetic human behavior data generated by a photorealistic simulator, and evaluate the resulting models on both synthetic and real-world sequences to assess their generalization capabilities. Leveraging Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), CAMP-VLM outperforms the best-performing baseline by up to 66.9% in prediction accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "CAMP-VLM\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u4ece\u7b2c\u4e09\u4eba\u79f0\u89c6\u89d2\u9884\u6d4b\u591a\u4eba\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u90fd\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u7684\u5355\u4eba\u884c\u4e3a\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f46\u8bb8\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u7b2c\u4e09\u4eba\u79f0\u89c6\u89d2\u7406\u89e3\u591a\u4eba\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCAMP-VLM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u7167\u7247\u7ea7\u771f\u5b9e\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03(SFT)\u548c\u76f4\u63a5\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316(DPO)\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "CAMP-VLM\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0a\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6bd4\u6700\u4f73\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad8\u51fa66.9%\u3002", "conclusion": "CAMP-VLM\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u9884\u6d4b\u591a\u4eba\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7406\u89e3\u4eba\u7c7b\u7fa4\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Conventional approaches estimate the flying robot's position using fixed cameras observing pre-attached markers, which could be constrained by limited distance and susceptible to capture failure. To address this issue, we improve the ground-aerial localization framework in a more comprehensive manner, which integrates active vision, single-ranging, inertial odometry, and optical flow. First, the designed active vision subsystem mounted on the ground vehicle can be dynamically rotated to detect and track infrared markers on the aerial robot, improving the field of view and the target recognition with a single camera. Meanwhile, the incorporation of single-ranging extends the feasible distance and enhances re-capture capability under visual degradation. During estimation, a dimension-reduced estimator fuses multi-source measurements based on polynomial approximation with an extended sliding window, balancing computational efficiency and redundancy. Considering different sensor fidelities, an adaptive sliding confidence evaluation algorithm is implemented to assess measurement quality and dynamically adjust the weighting parameters based on moving variance. Finally, extensive experiments under conditions such as smoke interference, illumination variation, obstacle occlusion, prolonged visual loss, and extended operating range demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves robust online localization, with an average root mean square error of approximately 0.09 m, while maintaining resilience to capture loss and sensor failures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5730\u9762-\u7a7a\u4e2d\u534f\u540c\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u52a8\u89c6\u89c9\u3001\u5355\u70b9\u6d4b\u8ddd\u3001\u60ef\u6027\u91cc\u7a0b\u8ba1\u548c\u5149\u6d41\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u98de\u884c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u9000\u5316\u65f6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u89c2\u6d4b\u9884\u7f6e\u6807\u8bb0\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u98de\u884c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u4f46\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e14\u6613\u53d7\u6355\u83b7\u5931\u8d25\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u9000\u5316\u7684\u6742\u4e71\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "1) \u5730\u9762\u8f66\u8f86\u642d\u8f7d\u4e3b\u52a8\u89c6\u89c9\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u53ef\u52a8\u6001\u65cb\u8f6c\u68c0\u6d4b\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7a7a\u4e2d\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u7ea2\u5916\u6807\u8bb0\uff1b2) \u7ed3\u5408\u5355\u70b9\u6d4b\u8ddd\u6269\u5c55\u53ef\u884c\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u89c6\u89c9\u9000\u5316\u4e0b\u7684\u91cd\u6355\u83b7\u80fd\u529b\uff1b3) \u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7684\u964d\u7ef4\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u878d\u5408\u591a\u6e90\u6d4b\u91cf\uff1b4) \u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6ed1\u52a8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b97\u6cd5\u6839\u636e\u79fb\u52a8\u65b9\u5dee\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u6743\u91cd\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u70df\u96fe\u5e72\u6270\u3001\u5149\u7167\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u969c\u788d\u7269\u906e\u6321\u3001\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u89c6\u89c9\u4e22\u5931\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u64cd\u4f5c\u8303\u56f4\u7b49\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u5747\u65b9\u6839\u8bef\u5dee\u7ea6\u4e3a0.09\u7c73\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u6355\u83b7\u4e22\u5931\u548c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6545\u969c\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5730\u9762-\u7a7a\u4e2d\u534f\u540c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u4e3b\u52a8\u89c6\u89c9\u3001\u5355\u70b9\u6d4b\u8ddd\u548c\u591a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u98de\u884c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u5728\u7ebf\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u56fa\u5b9a\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

Generative models have demonstrated promising results in creating full-body nonverbal animations synchronized with speech; however, evaluations using statistical metrics in 2D settings fail to fully capture user-perceived emotions, limiting our understanding of model effectiveness. To address this, we evaluate emotional 3D animation generative models within a Virtual Reality (VR) environment, emphasizing user-centric metrics emotional arousal realism, naturalness, enjoyment, diversity, and interaction quality in a real-time human-agent interaction scenario. Through a user study (N=48), we examine perceived emotional quality for three state of the art speech-driven 3D animation methods across two emotions happiness (high arousal) and neutral (mid arousal). Additionally, we compare these generative models against real human expressions obtained via a reconstruction-based method to assess both their strengths and limitations and how closely they replicate real human facial and body expressions. Our results demonstrate that methods explicitly modeling emotions lead to higher recognition accuracy compared to those focusing solely on speech-driven synchrony. Users rated the realism and naturalness of happy animations significantly higher than those of neutral animations, highlighting the limitations of current generative models in handling subtle emotional states. Generative models underperformed compared to reconstruction-based methods in facial expression quality, and all methods received relatively low ratings for animation enjoyment and interaction quality, emphasizing the importance of incorporating user-centric evaluations into generative model development. Finally, participants positively recognized animation diversity across all generative models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5728VR\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u8bed\u97f3\u9a71\u52a8\u76843D\u52a8\u753b\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u5feb\u4e50\u548c\u4e2d\u6027\u4e24\u79cd\u60c5\u7eea\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u60c5\u7eea\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u6240\u6709\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9762\u90e8\u8868\u60c5\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u90fd\u843d\u540e\u4e8e\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u521b\u5efa\u4e0e\u8bed\u97f3\u540c\u6b65\u7684\u975e\u8bed\u8a00\u52a8\u753b\uff0c\u4f46\u57fa\u4e8e2D\u7edf\u8ba1\u6307\u6807\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u6355\u6349\u7528\u6237\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u60c5\u611f\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6211\u4eec\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u679c\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5728VR\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u7528\u6237\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u5730\u8861\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5728VR\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76(N=48)\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e09\u79cd\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u9a71\u52a83D\u52a8\u753b\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5feb\u4e50(\u9ad8\u5524\u9192)\u548c\u4e2d\u6027(\u4e2d\u5524\u9192)\u4e24\u79cd\u60c5\u7eea\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u83b7\u53d6\u771f\u5b9e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8868\u60c5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u5305\u62ec\u60c5\u611f\u5524\u9192\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3001\u81ea\u7136\u5ea6\u3001\u6109\u60a6\u5ea6\u3001\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u60c5\u7eea\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u8bed\u97f3\u540c\u6b65\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff1b\u5feb\u4e50\u52a8\u753b\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u81ea\u7136\u5ea6\u8bc4\u5206\u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u4e8e\u4e2d\u6027\u52a8\u753b\uff1b\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9762\u90e8\u8868\u60c5\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u4e0d\u5982\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u6240\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u52a8\u753b\u6109\u60a6\u5ea6\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u8bc4\u5206\u76f8\u5bf9\u8f83\u4f4e\uff1b\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u52a8\u753b\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7ed9\u4e88\u79ef\u6781\u8ba4\u53ef\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5fae\u5999\u60c5\u611f\u72b6\u6001\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9762\u90e8\u8868\u60c5\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8868\u8fbe\u4ecd\u6709\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5c06\u7528\u6237\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u7eb3\u5165\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728VR\u4ea4\u4e92\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u63d0\u5347\u52a8\u753b\u7684\u6109\u60a6\u5ea6\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

However, the limited availability of annotated multispectral data severely restricts the training of deep detectors. In such data-scarce scenarios, textual class information can serve as a valuable source of semantic supervision. Motivated by the recent success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in computer vision, we explore their potential for few-shot multispectral object detection. Specifically, we adapt two representative VLM-based detectors, Grounding DINO and YOLO-World, to handle multispectral inputs and propose an effective mechanism to integrate text, visual and thermal modalities. Through extensive experiments on two popular multispectral image benchmarks, FLIR and M3FD, we demonstrate that VLM-based detectors not only excel in few-shot regimes, significantly outperforming specialized multispectral models trained with comparable data, but also achieve competitive or superior results under fully supervised settings. Our findings reveal that the semantic priors learned by large-scale VLMs effectively transfer to unseen spectral modalities, ofFering a powerful pathway toward data-efficient multispectral perception.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u591a\u5149\u8c31\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9002\u914dGrounding DINO\u548cYOLO-World\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u591a\u5149\u8c31\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u5728FLIR\u548cM3FD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e13\u7528\u591a\u5149\u8c31\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u5149\u8c31\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u548c\u76d1\u63a7\u7b49\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7a00\u7f3a\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u6587\u672c\u7c7b\u522b\u4fe1\u606f\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u76d1\u7763\u6e90\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u4e24\u79cd\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684VLM\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff08Grounding DINO\u548cYOLO-World\uff09\u9002\u914d\u5230\u591a\u5149\u8c31\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6709\u6548\u7684\u673a\u5236\u6765\u6574\u5408\u6587\u672c\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u70ed\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5728FLIR\u548cM3FD\u4e24\u4e2a\u591a\u5149\u8c31\u56fe\u50cf\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cVLM\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u6bd4\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u591a\u5149\u8c31\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u5168\u76d1\u7763\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u4e5f\u8fbe\u5230\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u6216\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21VLM\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5148\u9a8c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u591a\u5149\u8c31\u611f\u77e5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Paralleling this offline model of care, people who seek mental health support from AI chatbots are similarly provided little context for how their expressions of distress are processed by the model, and subsequently, the logic that may underlie model responses. People in severe distress who turn to AI chatbots for support thus find themselves caught between black boxes, with unique forms of agony that arise from these intersecting opacities, including misinterpreting model outputs or attributing greater capabilities to a model than are yet possible, which has led to documented real-world harms. Building on empirical research from clinical psychology and AI safety, alongside rights-oriented frameworks from medical ethics, we describe how the distinct psychological state induced by severe distress can influence chatbot interaction patterns, and argue that this state of mind (combined with differences in how a user might perceive a chatbot compared to a care provider) uniquely necessitates a higher standard of interpretability in comparison to general AI chatbot use. Drawing inspiration from newer interpretable treatment paradigms, we then describe specific technical and interface design approaches that could be used to adapt interpretability strategies from four specific mental health fields (psychotherapy, community-based crisis intervention, psychiatry, and care authorization) to AI models, including consideration of the role of interpretability in the treatment process and tensions that may arise with greater interpretability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7AI\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7f3a\u4e4f\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u4e25\u91cd\u5fc3\u7406\u56f0\u6270\u7528\u6237\u9762\u4e34\u53cc\u91cd\"\u9ed1\u7bb1\"\u56f0\u5883\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4ece\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u9886\u57df\u501f\u9274\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6280\u672f\u548c\u754c\u9762\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u62a4\u7406\u548cAI\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u90fd\u5b58\u5728\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e25\u91cd\u5fc3\u7406\u56f0\u6270\u7684\u7528\u6237\u9762\u4e34\u53cc\u91cd\"\u9ed1\u7bb1\"\u56f0\u5883\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bef\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u3001\u9ad8\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u7b49\u73b0\u5b9e\u5371\u5bb3\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6807\u51c6\u6765\u4fdd\u62a4\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8106\u5f31\u7528\u6237\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u4e34\u5e8a\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u548cAI\u5b89\u5168\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u501f\u9274\u533b\u5b66\u4f26\u7406\u7684\u6743\u5229\u5bfc\u5411\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e25\u91cd\u5fc3\u7406\u56f0\u6270\u72b6\u6001\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u4ece\u56db\u4e2a\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5fc3\u7406\u6cbb\u7597\u3001\u793e\u533a\u5371\u673a\u5e72\u9884\u3001\u7cbe\u795e\u75c5\u5b66\u3001\u62a4\u7406\u6388\u6743\uff09\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7b56\u7565\u4e2d\u6c72\u53d6\u7075\u611f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u6280\u672f\u548c\u754c\u9762\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e25\u91cd\u5fc3\u7406\u56f0\u6270\u72b6\u6001\uff08\u7ed3\u5408\u7528\u6237\u5bf9\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u611f\u77e5\u65b9\u5f0f\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff09\u72ec\u7279\u5730\u9700\u8981\u6bd4\u4e00\u822cAI\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6807\u51c6\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5c06\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u9886\u57df\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7b56\u7565\u9002\u5e94AI\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5728\u6cbb\u7597\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u4ee5\u53ca\u53ef\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u5f20\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7AI\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u501f\u9274\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u9886\u57df\u7684\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u5b9e\u8df5\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u4e25\u91cd\u5fc3\u7406\u56f0\u6270\u7528\u6237\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u56e0\u53cc\u91cd\"\u9ed1\u7bb1\"\u9020\u6210\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5371\u5bb3\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5e73\u8861\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u6cbb\u7597\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002"}}

Earles"], "title": "Are vision-language models ready to zero-shot replace supervised classification models in agriculture?", "comment": "Draft version", "summary": "Vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly proposed as general-purpose solutions for visual recognition tasks, yet their reliability for agricultural decision support remains poorly understood. We benchmark a diverse set of open-source and closed-source VLMs on 27 agricultural classification datasets from the AgML collection, spanning 162 classes across plant disease, pest and damage, and plant and weed species identification. Across all tasks, zero-shot VLMs substantially underperform a supervised task-specific baseline (YOLO11), which consistently achieves markedly higher accuracy than any foundation model. Under multiple-choice prompting, the best-performing VLM (Gemini-3 Pro) reaches approximately 62% average accuracy, while open-ended prompting yields much lower performance, with raw accuracies typically below 25%. Applying LLM-based semantic judging increases open-ended accuracy (for example, from 21% to 30% for top models) and alters model rankings, demonstrating that evaluation methodology meaningfully affects reported conclusions. Among open-source models, Qwen-VL-72B performs best, approaching closed-source performance under constrained prompting but still trailing top proprietary systems. Task-level analysis shows that plant and weed species classification is consistently easier than pest and damage identification, which remains the most challenging category across models. Overall, these results indicate that current off-the-shelf VLMs are not yet suitable as standalone agricultural diagnostic systems, but can function as assistive components when paired with constrained interfaces, explicit label ontologies, and domain-aware evaluation strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u5f00\u6e90\u548c\u95ed\u6e90\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u572827\u4e2a\u519c\u4e1a\u5206\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u96f6\u6837\u672cVLM\u6027\u80fd\u8fdc\u4f4e\u4e8e\u4e13\u7528\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f53\u524dVLM\u5c1a\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u4f5c\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u519c\u4e1a\u8bca\u65ad\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f85\u52a9\u7ec4\u4ef6\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u88ab\u63d0\u8bae\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u901a\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u519c\u4e1a\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4ecd\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30VLM\u5728\u519c\u4e1a\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528AgML\u96c6\u5408\u4e2d\u768427\u4e2a\u519c\u4e1a\u5206\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08162\u4e2a\u7c7b\u522b\uff09\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u690d\u7269\u75c5\u5bb3\u3001\u5bb3\u866b\u548c\u635f\u5bb3\u3001\u690d\u7269\u548c\u6742\u8349\u7269\u79cd\u8bc6\u522b\u3002\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u5f00\u6e90\u548c\u95ed\u6e90VLM\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u591a\u9879\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5224\u65ad\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u96f6\u6837\u672cVLM\u5728\u6240\u6709\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f4e\u4e8e\u4e13\u7528\u76d1\u7763\u57fa\u7ebf\uff08YOLO11\uff09\u3002\u6700\u4f73VLM\uff08Gemini-3 Pro\uff09\u5728\u591a\u9879\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230\u7ea662%\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u800c\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u63d0\u793a\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u4f4e\uff08\u901a\u5e38\u4f4e\u4e8e25%\uff09\u3002\u5e94\u7528LLM\u8bed\u4e49\u5224\u65ad\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad8\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff08\u5982\u4ece21%\u63d0\u5347\u81f330%\uff09\u3002\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u4e2dQwen-VL-72B\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1\u95ed\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u4f46\u4ecd\u6709\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002\u690d\u7269\u548c\u6742\u8349\u7269\u79cd\u5206\u7c7b\u6bd4\u5bb3\u866b\u548c\u635f\u5bb3\u8bc6\u522b\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u73b0\u6210\u7684VLM\u5c1a\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u4f5c\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u519c\u4e1a\u8bca\u65ad\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f85\u52a9\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u914d\u5408\u7ea6\u675f\u754c\u9762\u3001\u660e\u786e\u6807\u7b7e\u672c\u4f53\u548c\u9886\u57df\u611f\u77e5\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b56\u7565\u4f7f\u7528\u3002"}}

Stichting ThingsCon Amsterdam", "summary": "This essay explores a techno-artistic experiment that reanimates a 1980s East German typewriter using a contemporary AI language model. Situated at the intersection of media archaeology and speculative design, the project questions dominant narratives of progress by embedding generative AI in an obsolete, tactile interface. Through public exhibitions and aesthetic intervention, we demonstrate how slowness, friction, and material render artificial intelligence not only visible but open to critical inquiry. Drawing on concepts such as zombie media, technostalgia, and speculative design, we argue that reappropriating outdated technologies enables new forms of critical engagement. Erika - the AI-enabled typewriter - functions as both interface and interruption, making space for reflection, irony, and cultural memory. In a moment of accelerated digital abstraction, projects like this foreground the value of deliberate slowness, experiential materiality, and historical depth. We conclude by advocating for a historicist design sensibility that challenges presentism and reorients human-machine interaction toward alternative, perceived futures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c061980\u5e74\u4ee3\u4e1c\u5fb7\u6253\u5b57\u673a\u4e0e\u5f53\u4ee3AI\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u6280\u672f\u827a\u672f\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5a92\u4f53\u8003\u53e4\u5b66\u548c\u601d\u8fa8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u6b65\u7684\u4e3b\u6d41\u53d9\u4e8b\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u7f13\u6162\u3001\u6469\u64e6\u548c\u7269\u8d28\u6027\u5728AI\u6279\u5224\u6027\u63a2\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "motivation": "\u6311\u6218\u6570\u5b57\u65f6\u4ee3\u52a0\u901f\u62bd\u8c61\u548c\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u6b65\u7684\u4e3b\u6d41\u53d9\u4e8b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5d4c\u5165\u8fc7\u65f6\u7684\u89e6\u89c9\u754c\u9762\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u4f7fAI\u53d8\u5f97\u53ef\u89c1\u5e76\u5f00\u653e\u4e8e\u6279\u5224\u6027\u63a2\u7a76\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u7f13\u6162\u3001\u6469\u64e6\u548c\u7269\u8d28\u6027\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5a92\u4f53\u8003\u53e4\u5b66\u548c\u601d\u8fa8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u5f53\u4ee3AI\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6574\u5408\u52301980\u5e74\u4ee3\u4e1c\u5fb7\u6253\u5b57\u673a\u4e2d\uff0c\u521b\u5efa\u540d\u4e3aErika\u7684AI\u589e\u5f3a\u6253\u5b57\u673a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u516c\u5171\u5c55\u89c8\u548c\u7f8e\u5b66\u5e72\u9884\u5c55\u793a\u8fd9\u4e00\u6280\u672f\u827a\u672f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "Erika\u6253\u5b57\u673a\u4f5c\u4e3a\u754c\u9762\u548c\u4e2d\u65ad\uff0c\u521b\u9020\u4e86\u53cd\u601d\u3001\u8bbd\u523a\u548c\u6587\u5316\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8fc7\u65f6\u6280\u672f\u91cd\u65b0\u5229\u7528\u5982\u4f55\u4fc3\u8fdb\u65b0\u7684\u6279\u5224\u6027\u53c2\u4e0e\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u52a0\u901f\u6570\u5b57\u62bd\u8c61\u65f6\u4ee3\u51f8\u663e\u4e86\u523b\u610f\u7f13\u6162\u3001\u4f53\u9a8c\u7269\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u5386\u53f2\u6df1\u5ea6\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5021\u5bfc\u4e00\u79cd\u5386\u53f2\u4e3b\u4e49\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u5f53\u4e0b\u4e3b\u4e49\uff0c\u5c06\u4eba\u673a\u4e92\u52a8\u91cd\u65b0\u5bfc\u5411\u53ef\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u672a\u6765\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u65b0\u5229\u7528\u8fc7\u65f6\u6280\u672f\u6765\u521b\u9020\u6279\u5224\u6027\u53c2\u4e0e\u7684\u65b0\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Our approach automatically provides action labels for video diffusion models, overcoming the common lack of action annotations and enabling their full use for robotic policy learning. Existing methods either adopt two-stage pipelines, which limit tightly coupled cross-modal information sharing, or rely on adapting a single-modal diffusion model for a joint distribution that cannot fully leverage pretrained video knowledge. To overcome these limitations, we (1) extend a pretrained video diffusion model with a parallel, dedicated action diffusion model that preserves pretrained knowledge, (2) introduce a Bridge Attention mechanism to enable effective cross-modal interaction, and (3) design an action refinement module to convert coarse actions into precise controls for low-resolution datasets. Extensive evaluations on multiple public benchmarks and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method generates higher-quality videos, more accurate actions, and significantly outperforms existing baselines, offering a scalable framework for leveraging large-scale video data for robotic learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ece\u521d\u59cb\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5173\u8282\u72b6\u6001\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891-\u52a8\u4f5c\u5bf9\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u4f9b\u52a8\u4f5c\u6807\u6ce8\u6765\u514b\u670d\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u52a8\u4f5c\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u5b8c\u5168\u7528\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u7a0b\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u5171\u4eab\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u9891\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u7f3a\u4e4f\u52a8\u4f5c\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "(1) \u6269\u5c55\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6dfb\u52a0\u5e76\u884c\u4e13\u7528\u52a8\u4f5c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u4fdd\u7559\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u77e5\u8bc6\uff1b(2) \u5f15\u5165\u6865\u63a5\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\uff1b(3) \u8bbe\u8ba1\u52a8\u4f5c\u7ec6\u5316\u6a21\u5757\u5c06\u7c97\u7565\u52a8\u4f5c\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u3001\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5229\u7528\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u52a8\u4f5c\u6807\u6ce8\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u9650\u5236\u3002"}}

While fixed target sizes suffice in static setups, in mobile settings, frequent posture changes alter viewing distances, which in turn distort perceived size and hinder dwell performance. We address this through GAUI, a Gaze-based Adaptive User Interface that dynamically resizes targets to maximise performance at the given viewing distance. In a two-phased study (N=24), GAUI leveraged the strengths of its distance-responsive design, outperforming the large UI static baseline in task time, and being less error-prone than the small UI static baseline.

Estimating FOD from single-shell low angular resolution dMRI (LAR-FOD) is limited by accuracy, whereas estimating FOD from multi-shell high angular resolution dMRI (HAR-FOD) requires a long scanning time, which limits its applicability. Diffusion models have shown promise in estimating HAR-FOD based on LAR-FOD. However, using diffusion models to efficiently generate HAR-FOD is challenging due to the large number of spherical harmonic (SH) coefficients in FOD. Here, we propose a 3D multi-channel patch diffusion model to predict HAR-FOD from LAR-FOD. We design the FOD-patch adapter by introducing the prior brain anatomy for more efficient patch-based learning. Furthermore, we introduce a voxel-level conditional coordinating module to enhance the global understanding of the model. We design the SH attention module to effectively learn the complex correlations of the SH coefficients.

This provides an ideal platform for innovation in both mechanical design and stylized motion control. In this paper, we bring Olaf to life in the physical world, relying on reinforcement learning guided by animation references for control. To create the illusion of Olaf's feet moving along his body, we hide two asymmetric legs under a soft foam skirt. To fit actuators inside the character, we use spherical and planar linkages in the arms, mouth, and eyes. Because the walk cycle results in harsh contact sounds, we introduce additional rewards that noticeably reduce impact noise.

The multi-camera setup introduces substantial redundancy and irrelevant information, which increases computational costs and forces the model to spend extra training time extracting crucial task-relevant details. To filter out redundant information and accurately extract task-relevant features, we propose the VERM (Virtual Eye for Robotic Manipulation) method, leveraging the knowledge in foundation models to imagine a virtual task-adaptive view from the constructed 3D point cloud, which efficiently captures necessary information and mitigates occlusion. To facilitate 3D action planning and fine-grained manipulation, we further design a depth-aware module and a dynamic coarse-to-fine procedure. Extensive experimental results on both simulation benchmark RLBench and real-world evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods while achieving 1.89x speedup in training time and 1.54x speedup in inference speed.

Their cascaded design further propagates perception errors, degrading downstream planning and control. Vision-Action (VA) models address some limitations by learning direct mappings from visual inputs to actions, but they remain opaque, sensitive to distribution shifts, and lack structured reasoning or instruction-following capabilities. Recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal learning has motivated the emergence of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) frameworks, which integrate perception with language-grounded decision making. By unifying visual understanding, linguistic reasoning, and actionable outputs, VLAs offer a pathway toward more interpretable, generalizable, and human-aligned driving policies. This work provides a structured characterization of the emerging VLA landscape for autonomous driving. We trace the evolution from early VA approaches to modern VLA frameworks and organize existing methods into two principal paradigms: End-to-End VLA, which integrates perception, reasoning, and planning within a single model, and Dual-System VLA, which separates slow deliberation (via VLMs) from fast, safety-critical execution (via planners). Within these paradigms, we further distinguish subclasses such as textual vs. numerical action generators and explicit vs. implicit guidance mechanisms. We also summarize representative datasets and benchmarks for evaluating VLA-based driving systems and highlight key challenges and open directions, including robustness, interpretability, and instruction fidelity.

This study examines how different forms of epistemic failure emerge, are masked, and are tolerated in human AI interaction, where failure is understood as a relational breakdown shaped by model-generated plausibility and human interpretive judgment. We conducted a three round, multi LLM evaluation using interdisciplinary tasks and progressively differentiated assessment frameworks to observe how evaluators interpret model responses across linguistic, epistemic, and credibility dimensions. Our findings show that LLM errors shift from predictive to hermeneutic forms, where linguistic fluency, structural coherence, and superficially plausible citations conceal deeper distortions of meaning. Evaluators frequently conflated criteria such as correctness, relevance, bias, groundedness, and consistency, indicating that human judgment collapses analytical distinctions into intuitive heuristics shaped by form and fluency. Across rounds, we observed a systematic verification burden and cognitive drift. As tasks became denser, evaluators increasingly relied on surface cues, allowing erroneous yet well formed answers to pass as credible. These results suggest that error is not solely a property of model behavior but a co-constructed outcome of generative plausibility and human interpretive shortcuts. Understanding AI epistemic failure therefore requires reframing evaluation as a relational interpretive process, where the boundary between system failure and human miscalibration becomes porous.

However, most VLMs are trained primarily on third-person data, creating a fundamental viewpoint mismatch for humanoid robots. Scaling robot egocentric data collection remains impractical due to high cost and limited diversity, whereas large-scale human egocentric videos offer a scalable alternative that naturally capture rich interaction context and causal structure. The key challenge is to convert raw egocentric videos into structured and reliable embodiment training supervision. Accordingly, we propose an Egocentric2Embodiment translation pipeline that transforms first-person videos into multi-level, schema-driven VQA supervision with enforced evidence grounding and temporal consistency, enabling the construction of the Egocentric2Embodiment dataset (E2E-3M) at scale. An egocentric-aware embodied brain, termed PhysBrain, is obtained by training on the E2E-3M dataset.

To this end, we develop a multi-view self-supervised pipeline to automatically generate skeleton data, complemented by heuristic rules and expert refinement for semi-automatic annotation. Based on this pipeline, we introduce OMG-Bench, the first large-scale public benchmark for skeleton-based online micro gesture recognition. It features 40 fine-grained gesture classes with 13,948 instances across 1,272 sequences, characterized by subtle motions, rapid dynamics, and continuous execution. To tackle these challenges, we propose Hierarchical Memory-Augmented Transformer (HMATr), an end-to-end framework that unifies gesture detection and classification by leveraging hierarchical memory banks which store frame-level details and window-level semantics to preserve historical context. In addition, it employs learnable position-aware queries initialized from the memory to implicitly encode gesture positions and semantics. Experiments show that HMATr outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 7.6\\% in detection rate, establishing a strong baseline for online micro gesture recognition.

This paper introduces a novel camera calibration method using a designed collimator system. Our collimator system provides a reliable and controllable calibration environment for the camera. Exploiting the unique optical geometry property of our collimator system, we introduce an angle invariance constraint and further prove that the relative motion between the calibration target and camera conforms to a spherical motion model. This constraint reduces the original 6DOF relative motion between target and camera to a 3DOF pure rotation motion. Using spherical motion constraint, a closed-form linear solver for multiple images and a minimal solver for two images are proposed for camera calibration. Furthermore, we propose a single collimator image calibration algorithm based on the angle invariance constraint.

Benchmarking in robotics is historically challenging due to the stochasticity, reproducibility, and time-consuming nature of real-world rollouts. This challenge is exacerbated for recent generalist policies, which has to be evaluated across a wide variety of scenes and tasks. Evaluation in simulation offers a scalable complement to real world evaluations, but the visual and physical domain gap between existing simulation benchmarks and the real world has made them an unreliable signal for policy improvement. Furthermore, building realistic and diverse simulated environments has traditionally required significant human effort and expertise. To bridge the gap, we introduce Policy Evaluation and Environment Reconstruction in Simulation (PolaRiS), a scalable real-to-sim framework for high-fidelity simulated robot evaluation. PolaRiS utilizes neural reconstruction methods to turn short video scans of real-world scenes into interactive simulation environments. Additionally, we develop a simple simulation data co-training recipe that bridges remaining real-to-sim gaps and enables zero-shot evaluation in unseen simulation environments. Through extensive paired evaluations between simulation and the real world, we demonstrate that PolaRiS evaluations provide a much stronger correlation to real world generalist policy performance than existing simulated benchmarks. Its simplicity also enables rapid creation of diverse simulated environments. As such, this work takes a step towards distributed and democratized evaluation for the next generation of robotic foundation models.", "AI": {"tldr": "PolaRiS\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u5230\u4eff\u771f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecf\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u89c6\u9891\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u4eff\u771f\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7b56\u7565\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u4eff\u771f\u57fa\u51c6\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5173\u8054\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b66\u4e60\u7814\u7a76\u9762\u4e34\u51c6\u786e\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u6bd4\u8f83\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b58\u5728\u968f\u673a\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u5dee\u548c\u8017\u65f6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u4eff\u771f\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5b58\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u7269\u7406\u9886\u57df\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u53ef\u9760\u53cd\u6620\u7b56\u7565\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "PolaRiS\u5229\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u573a\u666f\u7684\u77ed\u89c6\u9891\u626b\u63cf\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u4eff\u771f\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4eff\u771f\u6570\u636e\u534f\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f25\u5408\u5269\u4f59\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u5230\u4eff\u771f\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u672a\u89c1\u4eff\u771f\u73af\u5883\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4eff\u771f\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u914d\u5bf9\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8bc1\u660ePolaRiS\u8bc4\u4f30\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u4eff\u771f\u57fa\u51c6\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u901a\u7528\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u5176\u7b80\u5355\u6027\u652f\u6301\u5feb\u901f\u521b\u5efa\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u73af\u5883\u3002", "conclusion": "PolaRiS\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u8fc8\u51fa\u4e86\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u548c\u6c11\u4e3b\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u4e00\u6b65\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u771f\u5b9e\u5230\u4eff\u771f\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7b56\u7565\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Although interaction detection for humans has been actively studied, a non-trivial challenge lies in cattle interaction detection, specifically the lack of a comprehensive behavioral dataset that includes interactions, as the interactions of grazing cattle are rare events. We, therefore, propose CattleAct, a data-efficient method for interaction detection by decomposing interactions into the combinations of actions by individual cattle. Specifically, we first learn an action latent space from a large-scale cattle action dataset. Then, we embed rare interactions via the fine-tuning of the pre-trained latent space using contrastive learning, thereby constructing a unified latent space of actions and interactions. On top of the proposed method, we develop a practical working system integrating video and GPS inputs. Experiments on a commercial-scale pasture demonstrate the accurate interaction detection achieved by our method compared to the baselines.

Existing procedural generation methods often have low output throughput, creating a significant bottleneck in scaling up dataset creation. In this work, we introduce Sceniris, a highly efficient procedural scene generation framework for rapidly generating large-scale, collision-free scene variations. Sceniris also provides an optional robot reachability check, providing manipulation-feasible scenes for robot tasks. Sceniris is designed for maximum efficiency by addressing the primary performance limitations of the prior method, Scene Synthesizer. Leveraging batch sampling and faster collision checking in cuRobo, Sceniris achieves at least 234x speed-up over Scene Synthesizer. Sceniris also expands the object-wise spatial relationships available in prior work to support diverse scene requirements.

Directly deploying Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with prompt tuning in downstream UDA tasks faces the signifi cant challenge of mitigating domain discrepancies. Existing prompt-tuning strategies primarily align marginal distribu tion, but neglect conditional distribution discrepancies, lead ing to critical issues such as class prototype misalignment and degraded semantic discriminability. To address these lim itations, the work proposes C-DGPA: Class-Centric Dual Alignment Generative Prompt Adaptation. C-DGPA syner gistically optimizes marginal distribution alignment and con ditional distribution alignment through a novel dual-branch architecture. The marginal distribution alignment branch em ploys a dynamic adversarial training framework to bridge marginal distribution discrepancies. Simultaneously, the con ditional distribution alignment branch introduces a Class Mapping Mechanism (CMM) to align conditional distribu tion discrepancies by standardizing semantic prompt under standing and preventing source domain over-reliance. This dual alignment strategy effectively integrates domain knowl edge into prompt learning via synergistic optimization, ensur ing domain-invariant and semantically discriminative repre sentations.

Unlike prior works, which focus on general, everyday motions and offer limited flexibility, our approach provides fine-grained control over body pose, appearance, camera viewpoint, and environmental context, without requiring any manual annotations. To validate the impact of Avatar4D, we focus on sports, where domain-specific human actions and movement patterns pose unique challenges for motion understanding. In this setting, we introduce Syn2Sport, a large-scale synthetic dataset spanning sports, including baseball and ice hockey. Avatar4D features high-fidelity 4D (3D geometry over time) human motion sequences with varying player appearances rendered in diverse environments. We benchmark several state-of-the-art pose estimation models on Syn2Sport and demonstrate their effectiveness for supervised learning, zero-shot transfer to real-world data, and generalization across sports. Furthermore, we evaluate how closely the generated synthetic data aligns with real-world datasets in feature space.

Despite recent progress in Large Medical Vision-Language Models (Med-VLMs), generating radiology reports that are both visually grounded and clinically accurate remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches often rely on large labeled corpora for pre-training, costly task-specific preference data, or retrieval-based methods. However, these strategies do not adequately mitigate hallucinations arising from poor cross-modal alignment between visual and linguistic representations. To address these limitations, we propose VALOR:Visual Alignment of Medical Vision-Language Models for GrOunded Radiology Report Generation. Our method introduces a reinforcement learning-based post-alignment framework utilizing Group-Relative Proximal Optimization (GRPO). The training proceeds in two stages: (1) improving the Med-VLM with textual rewards to encourage clinically precise terminology, and (2) aligning the vision projection module of the textually grounded model with disease findings, thereby guiding attention toward image re gions most relevant to the diagnostic task. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that VALOR substantially improves factual accuracy and visual grounding, achieving significant performance gains over state-of-the-art report generation methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "VALOR\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u540e\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7GRPO\u4f18\u5316\u533b\u5b66\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u653e\u5c04\u5b66\u62a5\u544a\u751f\u6210\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u51c6\u786e\u6027", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u533b\u5b66\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u653e\u5c04\u5b66\u62a5\u544a\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0d\u591f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u3001\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u504f\u597d\u6570\u636e\u6216\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u5f81\u4e4b\u95f4\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0d\u826f\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898", "method": "\u63d0\u51faVALOR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u6587\u672c\u5956\u52b1\u6539\u8fdbMed-VLM\u4ee5\u9f13\u52b1\u4e34\u5e8a\u7cbe\u786e\u672f\u8bed\uff1b2\uff09\u5c06\u6587\u672c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u6295\u5f71\u6a21\u5757\u4e0e\u75be\u75c5\u53d1\u73b0\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u4e0e\u8bca\u65ad\u4efb\u52a1\u6700\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u533a\u57df\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u540e\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u7ec4\u76f8\u5bf9\u8fd1\u7aef\u4f18\u5316\uff08GRPO\uff09", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cVALOR\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5728\u62a5\u544a\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347", "conclusion": "VALOR\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u540e\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u533b\u5b66\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u653e\u5c04\u5b66\u62a5\u544a\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u533b\u7597\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

However, comparing point clouds faces significant challenges due to their unstructured nature and the complex geometry of the surfaces they represent. Traditional geometric metrics such as Hausdorff and Chamfer distances often fail to capture global statistical structure and exhibit sensitivity to outliers, while existing Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence approximations for Gaussian Mixture Models can produce unbounded or numerically unstable values. This paper introduces an information geometric framework for 3D point cloud shape analysis by representing point clouds as Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) on a statistical manifold. We prove that the space of GMMs forms a statistical manifold and propose the Modified Symmetric Kullback-Leibler (MSKL) divergence with theoretically guaranteed upper and lower bounds, ensuring numerical stability for all GMM comparisons. Through comprehensive experiments on human pose discrimination (MPI-FAUST dataset) and animal shape comparison (G-PCD dataset), we demonstrate that MSKL provides stable and monotonically varying values that directly reflect geometric variation, outperforming traditional distances and existing KL approximations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u51e0\u4f55\u76843D\u70b9\u4e91\u5f62\u72b6\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u70b9\u4e91\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u7edf\u8ba1\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5177\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u754c\u548c\u4e0b\u754c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u4fee\u6b63\u5bf9\u79f0KL\u6563\u5ea6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u51e0\u4f55\u5ea6\u91cf\u5728\u70b9\u4e91\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e09\u7ef4\u70b9\u4e91\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u6bd4\u8f83\u70b9\u4e91\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u70b9\u4e91\u7684\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7279\u6027\u548c\u590d\u6742\u51e0\u4f55\u8868\u9762\u4f7f\u5f97\u4f20\u7edf\u51e0\u4f55\u5ea6\u91cf\uff08\u5982Hausdorff\u548cChamfer\u8ddd\u79bb\uff09\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u5168\u5c40\u7edf\u8ba1\u7ed3\u6784\u4e14\u5bf9\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578bKL\u6563\u5ea6\u8fd1\u4f3c\u53ef\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u65e0\u754c\u6216\u6570\u503c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4fe1\u606f\u51e0\u4f55\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u70b9\u4e91\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u7edf\u8ba1\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u8bc1\u660eGMM\u7a7a\u95f4\u6784\u6210\u7edf\u8ba1\u6d41\u5f62\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4fee\u6b63\u5bf9\u79f0KL\u6563\u5ea6\uff0c\u8be5\u5ea6\u91cf\u5177\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u754c\u548c\u4e0b\u754c\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u6240\u6709GMM\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4eba\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u5224\u522b\uff08MPI-FAUST\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff09\u548c\u52a8\u7269\u5f62\u72b6\u6bd4\u8f83\uff08G-PCD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMSKL\u63d0\u4f9b\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u5355\u8c03\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u6570\u503c\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u53cd\u6620\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u73b0\u6709KL\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u51e0\u4f55\u6846\u67b6\u548cMSKL\u6563\u5ea6\u4e3a3D\u70b9\u4e91\u5f62\u72b6\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u51e0\u4f55\u654f\u611f\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u70b9\u4e91\u6bd4\u8f83\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Existing methods fail to meet all three simultaneously. We propose ARMFlow, a MeanFlow-based autoregressive framework that models temporal dependencies between actor and reactor motions. It consists of a causal context encoder and an MLP-based velocity predictor. We introduce Bootstrap Contextual Encoding (BSCE) in training, encoding generated history instead of the ground-truth ones, to alleviate error accumulation in autoregressive generation. We further introduce the offline variant ReMFlow, achieving state-of-the-art performance with the fastest inference among offline methods. Our ARMFlow addresses key limitations of online settings by: (1) enhancing semantic alignment via a global contextual encoder; (2) achieving high accuracy and low latency in a single-step inference; and (3) reducing accumulated errors through BSCE. Our single-step online generation surpasses existing online methods on InterHuman and InterX by over 40% in FID, while matching offline state-of-the-art performance despite using only partial sequence conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "ARMFlow\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eMeanFlow\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e3D\u4eba\u4f53\u53cd\u5e94\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fd0\u52a8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5728\u5728\u7ebf\u548c\u79bb\u7ebf\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db33D\u4eba\u4f53\u53cd\u5e94\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u8981\u6c42\uff1a\u9ad8\u8fd0\u52a8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u7ebf\u573a\u666f\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u8fd9\u4e09\u4e2a\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faARMFlow\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u56e0\u679c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eMLP\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u3002\u5f15\u5165Bootstrap Contextual Encoding (BSCE)\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7f16\u7801\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u800c\u975e\u771f\u5b9e\u5386\u53f2\uff0c\u51cf\u8f7b\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u3002\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u79bb\u7ebf\u53d8\u4f53ReMFlow\u3002", "result": "\u5355\u6b65\u5728\u7ebf\u751f\u6210\u5728InterHuman\u548cInterX\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684FID\u6307\u6807\u8d85\u8fc7\u73b0\u6709\u5728\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd540%\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5339\u914d\u79bb\u7ebf\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u53ea\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u90e8\u5206\u5e8f\u5217\u6761\u4ef6\u3002\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u5728\u6240\u6709\u79bb\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u6700\u5feb\u3002", "conclusion": "ARMFlow\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e863D\u4eba\u4f53\u53cd\u5e94\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u589e\u5f3a\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5355\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0cBSCE\u51cf\u5c11\u7d2f\u79ef\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u5728\u5728\u7ebf\u548c\u79bb\u7ebf\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u90fd\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

However, due to the difficulty of collecting and annotating multi-view images, the datasets for multi-view counting have a limited number of multi-view frames and scenes. To solve the problem of limited data, one approach is to collect synthetic data to bypass the annotating step, while another is to propose semi- or weakly-supervised or unsupervised methods that demand less multi-view data. In this paper, we propose two semi-supervised multi-view crowd counting frameworks by ranking the multi-view fusion models of different numbers of input views, in terms of the model predictions or the model uncertainties. Specifically, for the first method (vanilla model), we rank the multi-view fusion models' prediction results of different numbers of camera-view inputs, namely, the model's predictions with fewer camera views shall not be larger than the predictions with more camera views. For the second method, we rank the estimated model uncertainties of the multi-view fusion models with a variable number of view inputs, guided by the multi-view fusion models' prediction errors, namely, the model uncertainties with more camera views shall not be larger than those with fewer camera views. These constraints are introduced into the model training in a semi-supervised fashion for multi-view counting with limited labeled data. The experiments demonstrate the advantages of the proposed multi-view model ranking methods compared with other semi-supervised counting methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4eba\u7fa4\u8ba1\u6570\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6392\u5e8f\u4e0d\u540c\u89c6\u89d2\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u6216\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4eba\u7fa4\u8ba1\u6570\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4eba\u7fa4\u8ba1\u6570\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8303\u56f4\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u906e\u6321\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u89c4\u6a21\u6709\u9650\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4eba\u7fa4\u8ba1\u6570\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u666e\u901a\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u8981\u6c42\u8f83\u5c11\u89c6\u89d2\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u5e94\u591a\u4e8e\u8f83\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b2\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u8981\u6c42\u8f83\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0d\u5e94\u5927\u4e8e\u8f83\u5c11\u89c6\u89d2\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ea6\u675f\u4ee5\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u5f0f\u5f15\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u6a21\u578b\u6392\u5e8f\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u5176\u4ed6\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u8ba1\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4eba\u7fa4\u8ba1\u6570\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6392\u5e8f\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6216\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u6709\u9650\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4eba\u7fa4\u8ba1\u6570\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, text editing within images remains largely unexplored, as it requires generating legible characters while preserving semantic, geometric, and contextual coherence. To fill this gap, we introduce TextEditBench, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark that explicitly focuses on text-centric regions in images. Beyond basic pixel manipulations, our benchmark emphasizes reasoning-intensive editing scenarios that require models to understand physical plausibility, linguistic meaning, and cross-modal dependencies. We further propose a novel evaluation dimension, Semantic Expectation (SE), which measures reasoning ability of model to maintain semantic consistency, contextual coherence, and cross-modal alignment during text editing. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art editing systems reveal that while current models can follow simple textual instructions, they still struggle with context-dependent reasoning, physical consistency, and layout-aware integration.

The multicollinearity will lead to ill-conditioned problems, resulting in significant instability and low robustness.

The key obstacles are the interrelated issues of sensing coverage, sensing reliability, and the dynamic participation of vehicles. To tackle these, we propose QUIDS, a QUality-informed Incentive-driven multi-agent Dispatching System, which ensures high sensing coverage and reliability under budget constraints. QUIDS introduces a novel metric, Aggregated Sensing Quality (ASQ), to quantitatively capture QoI by integrating both coverage and reliability. We also develop a Mutually Assisted Belief-aware Vehicle Dispatching algorithm that estimates sensing reliability and allocates incentives under uncertainty, further improving ASQ. Evaluation using real-world data from a metropolitan NVMCS deployment shows QUIDS improves ASQ by 38% over non-dispatching scenarios and by 10% over state-of-the-art methods. It also reduces reconstruction map errors by 39-74% across algorithms.

In typical deployments, visual data captured at edge devices (clients) is transmitted to the server for VLM inference. However, resizing the original image (global image) to match the vision encoder's input resolution often discards fine-grained details, leading to accuracy degradation. To overcome this limitation, we design a two-stage framework. In the first stage, the server performs inference on the global image and identifies a region of interest (RoI) using the VLM's internal attention. The min-entropy of the output tokens is then computed as a confidence measure to determine whether retransmission is required. If the min-entropy exceeds a predefined threshold, the server requests the edge device to send a detail-preserved local image of the RoI. The server then refines its inference by jointly leveraging the global and local images. This selective retransmission strategy ensures that only essential visual content is transmitted.

However, directly applying LDMs to HDR remains challenging due to: (1) limited dynamic-range representation caused by 8-bit latent compression, (2) high inference cost from multi-step denoising, and (3) content hallucination inherent to generative nature. To address these challenges, we introduce GMODiff, a gain map-driven one-step diffusion framework for multi-exposure HDR reconstruction. Instead of reconstructing full HDR content, we reformulate HDR reconstruction as a conditionally guided Gain Map (GM) estimation task, where the GM encodes the extended dynamic range while retaining the same bit depth as LDR images. We initialize the denoising process from an informative regression-based estimate rather than pure noise, enabling the model to generate high-quality GMs in a single denoising step. Furthermore, recognizing that regression-based models excel in content fidelity while LDMs favor perceptual quality, we leverage regression priors to guide both the denoising process and latent decoding of the LDM, suppressing hallucinations while preserving structural accuracy.

However, extending these advances to multi-character settings is non-trivial, especially when position swap is involved. Beyond mere scaling, the core challenge lies in enforcing correct Identity Correspondence (IC) between characters in reference and generated frames. To address this, we introduce EverybodyDance, a systematic solution targeting IC correctness in multi-character animation. EverybodyDance is built around the Identity Matching Graph (IMG), which models characters in the generated and reference frames as two node sets in a weighted complete bipartite graph. Edge weights, computed via our proposed Mask-Query Attention (MQA), quantify the affinity between each pair of characters. Our key insight is to formalize IC correctness as a graph structural metric and to optimize it during training.

In this paper, we argue that many errors, including apparent motion failures, originate from the model's inability to construct a semantically correct or logically consistent initial frame. We introduce Factorized Video Generation (FVG), a pipeline that decouples these tasks by decomposing the Text-to-Video generation into three specialized stages: (1) Reasoning, where a Large Language Model (LLM) rewrites the video prompt to describe only the initial scene, resolving temporal ambiguities; (2) Composition, where a Text-to-Image (T2I) model synthesizes a high-quality, compositionally-correct anchor frame from this new prompt; and (3) Temporal Synthesis, where a video model, finetuned to understand this anchor, focuses its entire capacity on animating the scene and following the prompt. Our decomposed approach sets a new state-of-the-art on the T2V CompBench benchmark and significantly improves all tested models on VBench2. Furthermore, we show that visual anchoring allows us to cut the number of sampling steps by 70% without any loss in performance, leading to a substantial speed-up in sampling.

Our approach utilizes Gaussian Splatting, since it is more explicit and thus more amenable to constraints than NeRFs. We leverage segmentation annotations to align the semantic regions of the face, facilitating the reconstruction of a neutral pose from only 11 images (as opposed to requiring a long video). We soft constrain the Gaussians to an underlying triangulated surface in order to provide a more structured Gaussian Splat reconstruction, which in turn informs subsequent perturbations to increase the accuracy of the underlying triangulated surface. The resulting triangulated surface can then be used in a standard graphics pipeline. In addition, and perhaps most impactful, we show how accurate geometry enables the Gaussian Splats to be transformed into texture space where they can be treated as a view-dependent neural texture. This allows one to use high visual fidelity Gaussian Splatting on any asset in a scene without the need to modify any other asset or any other aspect (geometry, lighting, renderer, etc.) of the graphics pipeline. We utilize a relightable Gaussian model to disentangle texture from lighting in order to obtain a delit high-resolution albedo texture that is also readily usable in a standard graphics pipeline. The flexibility of our system allows for training with disparate images, even with incompatible lighting, facilitating robust regularization.

We propose BrepLLM, the first framework that enables LLMs to parse and reason over raw Brep data, bridging the modality gap between structured 3D geometry and natural language. BrepLLM employs a two-stage training pipeline: Cross-modal Alignment Pre-training and Multi-stage LLM Fine-tuning. In the first stage, an adaptive UV sampling strategy converts Breps into graphs representation with geometric and topological information. We then design a hierarchical BrepEncoder to extract features from geometry (i.e., faces and edges) and topology, producing both a single global token and a sequence of node tokens. Then we align the global token with text embeddings from a frozen CLIP text encoder (ViT-L/14) via contrastive learning. In the second stage, we integrate the pretrained BrepEncoder into an LLM. We then align its sequence of node tokens using a three-stage progressive training strategy: (1) training an MLP-based semantic mapping from Brep representation to 2D with 2D-LLM priors.

Existing zero-shot object counting (ZOC) methods that infer exemplars from text either rely on open-vocabulary detectors, which often yield multi-instance candidates, or on random patch sampling, which fails to accurately delineate object instances. To address this, we propose CountZES, a training-free framework for object counting via zero-shot exemplar selection. CountZES progressively discovers diverse exemplars through three synergistic stages: Detection-Anchored Exemplar (DAE), Density-Guided Exemplar (DGE), and Feature-Consensus Exemplar (FCE). DAE refines open-vocabulary detections to isolate precise single-instance exemplars. DGE introduces a density-driven, self-supervised paradigm to identify statistically consistent and semantically compact exemplars, while FCE reinforces visual coherence through feature-space clustering. Together, these stages yield a diverse, complementary exemplar set that balances textual grounding, count consistency, and feature representativeness.

However, the VAR paradigm suffers from sharply increased computational complexity and running time at large-scale steps. Although existing acceleration methods reduce runtime for large-scale steps, but rely on manual step selection and overlook the varying importance of different stages in the generation process. To address this challenge, we present StageVAR, a systematic study and stage-aware acceleration framework for VAR models. Our analysis shows that early steps are critical for preserving semantic and structural consistency and should remain intact, while later steps mainly refine details and can be pruned or approximated for acceleration. Building on these insights, StageVAR introduces a plug-and-play acceleration strategy that exploits semantic irrelevance and low-rank properties in late-stage computations, without requiring additional training. Our proposed StageVAR achieves up to 3.4x speedup with only a 0.01 drop on GenEval and a 0.26 decrease on DPG, consistently outperforming existing acceleration baselines.

In this work, we investigate how a model can acquire both human-like and self-consistent reasoning capability for blind image quality assessment (BIQA).

Then, we adopt reinforcement learning, using human annotations as reward signals to guide the model toward human-like perception and reasoning. To enable the model to internalize self-consistent reasoning capability, we design a reward that drives the model to infer the image quality purely from self-generated descriptions. Empirically, our approach achieves score prediction performance comparable to state-of-the-art BIQA systems under general metrics, including Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients. In addition to the rating score, we assess human-model alignment using ROUGE-1 to measure the similarity between model-generated and human perception-reasoning chains.

Currently, the field heavily relies on facial expression recognition (FER) because visual channel conveys rich emotional cues. However, facial expressions are often used as social tools rather than manifestations of genuine inner emotions. To understand and bridge this gap between FER and ER, we introduce eye behaviors as an important emotional cue and construct an Eye-behavior-aided Multimodal Emotion Recognition (EMER) dataset. To collect data with genuine emotions, spontaneous emotion induction paradigm is exploited with stimulus material, during which non-invasive eye behavior data, like eye movement sequences and eye fixation maps, is captured together with facial expression videos. To better illustrate the gap between ER and FER, multi-view emotion labels for mutimodal ER and FER are separately annotated. Furthermore, based on the new dataset, we design a simple yet effective Eye-behavior-aided MER Transformer (EMERT) that enhances ER by bridging the emotion gap. EMERT leverages modality-adversarial feature decoupling and a multitask Transformer to model eye behaviors as a strong complement to facial expressions. In the experiment, we introduce seven multimodal benchmark protocols for a variety of comprehensive evaluations of the EMER dataset. The results show that the EMERT outperforms other state-of-the-art multimodal methods by a great margin, revealing the importance of modeling eye behaviors for robust ER. To sum up, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the importance of eye behaviors in ER, advancing the study on addressing the gap between FER and ER for more robust ER performance.

However, existing grounding benchmarks suffer from significant limitations: they either provide insufficient data volume and narrow domain coverage, or focus excessively on a single platform and require highly specialized domain knowledge. In this work, we present VenusBench-GD, a comprehensive, bilingual benchmark for GUI grounding that spans multiple platforms, enabling hierarchical evaluation for real-word applications. VenusBench-GD contributes as follows: (i) we introduce a large-scale, cross-platform benchmark with extensive coverage of applications, diverse UI elements, and rich annotated data, (ii) we establish a high-quality data construction pipeline for grounding tasks, achieving higher annotation accuracy than existing benchmarks, and (iii) we extend the scope of element grounding by proposing a hierarchical task taxonomy that divides grounding into basic and advanced categories, encompassing six distinct subtasks designed to evaluate models from complementary perspectives. Our experimental findings reveal critical insights: general-purpose multimodal models now match or even surpass specialized GUI models on basic grounding tasks. In contrast, advanced tasks, still favor GUI-specialized models, though they exhibit significant overfitting and poor robustness.

However, learning effective representations for skeleton-based temporal action localization remains challenging and underexplored. Unlike video-level {action} recognition, detecting action boundaries requires temporally sensitive features that capture subtle differences between adjacent frames where labels change. To this end, we formulate a snippet discrimination pretext task for self-supervised pretraining, which densely projects skeleton sequences into non-overlapping segments and promotes features that distinguish them across videos via contrastive learning. Additionally, we build on strong backbones of skeleton-based action recognition models by fusing intermediate features with a U-shaped module to enhance feature resolution for frame-level localization. Our approach consistently improves existing skeleton-based contrastive learning methods for action localization on BABEL across diverse subsets and evaluation protocols.

In this work, we propose N3D-VLM, a novel unified framework that seamlessly integrates native 3D object perception with 3D-aware visual reasoning, enabling both precise 3D grounding and interpretable spatial understanding. Unlike conventional end-to-end models that directly predict answers from RGB/RGB-D inputs, our approach equips the model with native 3D object perception capabilities, enabling it to directly localize objects in 3D space based on textual descriptions. Building upon accurate 3D object localization, the model further performs explicit reasoning in 3D, achieving more interpretable and structured spatial understanding. To support robust training for these capabilities, we develop a scalable data construction pipeline that leverages depth estimation to lift large-scale 2D annotations into 3D space, significantly increasing the diversity and coverage for 3D object grounding data, yielding over six times larger than the largest existing single-image 3D detection dataset. Moreover, the pipeline generates spatial question-answering datasets that target chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in 3D, facilitating joint training for both 3D object localization and 3D spatial reasoning.

In other words, we reconstruct not only the the currently visible parts of the scene, but also all previously viewed parts, which enables replaying the complete reconstruction across all timesteps.\n  Our method decomposes the scene into a set of rigid 3D primitives, which are assumed to be moving throughout the scene. Using estimated dense 2D correspondences, we jointly infer the rigid motion of these primitives through an optimisation pipeline, yielding a 4D reconstruction of the scene, i.e. providing 3D geometry dynamically moving through time. To achieve this, we also introduce a mechanism to extrapolate motion for objects that become invisible, employing motion-grouping techniques to maintain continuity.\n  The resulting system enables 4D spatio-temporal awareness, offering capabilities such as replayable 3D reconstructions of articulated objects through time, multi-object scanning, and object permanence.

Most existing works either train lightweight adapters or refine intermediate features to achieve better generalization on unseen domains. However, they both overlook the fact that long-term pre-trained VFMs often exhibit artifacts, which hinder the utilization of valuable representations and ultimately degrade DGSS performance. Inspired by causal mechanisms, we observe that these artifacts are associated with non-causal factors, which usually reside in the low- and high-frequency components of the VFM spectrum. In this paper, we explicitly examine the causal and non-causal factors of features within VFMs for DGSS, and propose a simple yet effective method to identify and disentangle them, enabling more robust domain generalization. Specifically, we propose Causal-Tune, a novel fine-tuning strategy designed to extract causal factors and suppress non-causal ones from the features of VFMs. First, we extract the frequency spectrum of features from each layer using the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). A Gaussian band-pass filter is then applied to separate the spectrum into causal and non-causal components. To further refine the causal components, we introduce a set of causal-aware learnable tokens that operate in the frequency domain, while the non-causal components are discarded. Finally, refined features are transformed back into the spatial domain via inverse DCT and passed to the next layer. Extensive experiments conducted on various cross-domain tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of Causal-Tune. In particular, our method achieves superior performance under adverse weather conditions, improving +4.8% mIoU over the baseline in snow conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCausal-Tune\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u57df\u5206\u6790\u5206\u79bb\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u4e0e\u975e\u56e0\u679c\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u57df\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u957f\u671f\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u4f2a\u5f71\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4f2a\u5f71\u4e0e\u975e\u56e0\u679c\u56e0\u7d20\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u8868\u793a\u7684\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8de8\u57df\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCausal-Tune\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u4f7f\u7528\u79bb\u6563\u4f59\u5f26\u53d8\u6362\u63d0\u53d6\u6bcf\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u9891\u8c31\uff1b2) \u5e94\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u5e26\u901a\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u5206\u79bb\u56e0\u679c\u548c\u975e\u56e0\u679c\u6210\u5206\uff1b3) \u5728\u9891\u57df\u5f15\u5165\u56e0\u679c\u611f\u77e5\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee4\u724c\u7ec6\u5316\u56e0\u679c\u6210\u5206\uff1b4) \u901a\u8fc7\u9006DCT\u5c06\u7cbe\u70bc\u7279\u5f81\u8f6c\u6362\u56de\u7a7a\u95f4\u57df", "result": "\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u8de8\u57df\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6076\u52a3\u5929\u6c14\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5728\u96ea\u5929\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u5347+4.8% mIoU", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u673a\u5236\u5206\u6790\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u53d6\u56e0\u679c\u56e0\u7d20\u5e76\u6291\u5236\u975e\u56e0\u679c\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8de8\u57df\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b"}}

Unlike current works that take predefined external toolkits or generate images during thinking, however, humans can form flexible visual-text imagination and interactions during thinking without predefined toolkits, where one important reason is that humans construct the visual-text thinking process in a unified space inside the brain. Inspired by this capability, given that current MLLMs already encode visual and text information in the same feature space, we hold that visual tokens can be seamlessly inserted into the reasoning process carried by text tokens, where ideally, all visual imagination processes can be encoded by the latent features. To achieve this goal, we propose Sketch-in-Latents (SkiLa), a novel paradigm for unified multi-modal reasoning that expands the auto-regressive capabilities of MLLMs to natively generate continuous visual embeddings, termed latent sketch tokens, as visual thoughts. During multi-step reasoning, the model dynamically alternates between textual thinking mode for generating textual think tokens and visual sketching mode for generating latent sketch tokens. A latent visual semantics reconstruction mechanism is proposed to ensure these latent sketch tokens are semantically grounded. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SkiLa achieves superior performance on vision-centric tasks while exhibiting strong generalization to diverse general multi-modal benchmarks.

Recent Top-K sparse attention approaches reduce the computation of DiTs by compressing tokens into block-wise representation and selecting a small set of relevant key blocks, but still suffer from (i) quadratic selection cost on compressed tokens and (ii) increasing K required to maintain model quality as sequences grow. We identify that their inefficiency is due to the single-level design, as a single coarse level is insufficient to represent the global structure. In this paper, we introduce Log-linear Sparse Attention (LLSA), a trainable sparse attention mechanism for extremely long token sequences that reduces both selection and attention costs from quadratic to log-linear complexity by utilizing a hierarchical structure. LLSA performs hierarchical Top-K selection, progressively adopting sparse Top-K selection with the indices found at the previous level, and introduces a Hierarchical KV Enrichment mechanism that preserves global context while using fewer tokens of different granularity during attention computation. To support efficient training, we develop a high-performance GPU implementation that uses only sparse indices for both the forward and backward passes, eliminating the need for dense attention masks. We evaluate LLSA on high-resolution pixel-space image generation without using patchification and VAE encoding. LLSA accelerates attention inference by 28.27x and DiT training by 6.09x on 256x256 pixel token sequences, while maintaining generation quality. The results demonstrate that LLSA offers a promising direction for training long-sequence DiTs efficiently.

One such application, indoor multimedia geolocation, has the potential to become a crucial aid for law enforcement in the fight against human trafficking, child exploitation, and other serious crimes. While outdoor multimedia geolocation has been widely explored, its indoor counterpart remains underdeveloped due to challenges such as similar room layouts, frequent renovations, visual ambiguity, indoor lighting variability, unreliable GPS signals, and limited datasets in sensitive domains. This paper introduces a pipeline that uses electric sockets as consistent indoor markers for geolocation, since plug socket types are standardised by country or region. The three-stage deep learning pipeline detects plug sockets (YOLOv11, mAP@0.5 = 0.843), classifies them into one of 12 plug socket types (Xception, accuracy = 0.912), and maps the detected socket types to countries (accuracy = 0.96 at >90% threshold confidence). To address data scarcity, two dedicated datasets were created: socket detection dataset of 2,328 annotated images expanded to 4,072 through augmentation, and a classification dataset of 3,187 images across 12 plug socket classes. The pipeline was evaluated on the Hotels-50K dataset, focusing on the TraffickCam subset of crowd-sourced hotel images, which capture real-world conditions such as poor lighting and amateur angles. This dataset provides a more realistic evaluation than using professional, well-lit, often wide-angle images from travel websites. This framework demonstrates a practical step toward real-world digital forensic applications.

However, the same power raises serious privacy concerns: personal images can be easily manipulated for identity impersonation, misinformation, or other malicious uses, all without the owner's consent. While prior work has explored input perturbations to protect against misuse in personalized text-to-image generation, the robustness of modern, large-scale in-context DiT-based models remains largely unexamined. In this paper, we propose DeContext, a new method to safeguard input images from unauthorized in-context editing. Our key insight is that contextual information from the source image propagates to the output primarily through multimodal attention layers. By injecting small, targeted perturbations that weaken these cross-attention pathways, DeContext breaks this flow, effectively decouples the link between input and output. This simple defense is both efficient and robust. We further show that early denoising steps and specific transformer blocks dominate context propagation, which allows us to concentrate perturbations where they matter most. Experiments on Flux Kontext and Step1X-Edit show that DeContext consistently blocks unwanted image edits while preserving visual quality. These results highlight the effectiveness of attention-based perturbations as a powerful defense against image manipulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "DeContext\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4fdd\u62a4\u56fe\u50cf\u514d\u53d7\u672a\u7ecf\u6388\u6743\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u5165\u5fae\u5c0f\u6270\u52a8\u6765\u524a\u5f31\u8de8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u963b\u65ad\u8f93\u5165\u4e0e\u8f93\u51fa\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u94fe\u63a5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u8f7b\u677e\u4fee\u6539\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u5e26\u6765\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u4e2a\u4eba\u56fe\u50cf\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u6076\u610f\u7528\u4e8e\u8eab\u4efd\u5192\u5145\u3001\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u7b49\u672a\u7ecf\u6388\u6743\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u800c\u5bf9\u73b0\u4ee3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u4e8eDiT\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "DeContext\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u5165\u5fae\u5c0f\u3001\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u6765\u524a\u5f31\u8de8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u963b\u65ad\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u4ece\u6e90\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u4f20\u64ad\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u65e9\u671f\u53bb\u566a\u6b65\u9aa4\u548c\u7279\u5b9atransformer\u5757\u4e3b\u5bfc\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u6270\u52a8\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u6700\u5173\u952e\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "\u5728Flux Kontext\u548cStep1X-Edit\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDeContext\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u963b\u6b62\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9632\u5fa1\u56fe\u50cf\u64cd\u7eb5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u62a4\u56fe\u50cf\u514d\u53d7\u672a\u7ecf\u6388\u6743\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u4e3a\u56fe\u50cf\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, existing SAR-oriented deep learning is constrained by data scarcity, while the physically grounded speckle noise in SAR imagery further hampers fine-grained semantic representation learning. To address these challenges, we propose SARMAE, a Noise-Aware Masked Autoencoder for self-supervised SAR representation learning. Specifically, we construct SAR-1M, the first million-scale SAR dataset, with additional paired optical images, to enable large-scale pre-training. Building upon this, we design Speckle-Aware Representation Enhancement (SARE), which injects SAR-specific speckle noise into masked autoencoders to facilitate noise-aware and robust representation learning. Furthermore, we introduce Semantic Anchor Representation Constraint (SARC), which leverages paired optical priors to align SAR features and ensure semantic consistency. Extensive experiments across multiple SAR datasets demonstrate that SARMAE achieves state-of-the-art performance on classification, detection, and segmentation tasks.

Recent works inject semantics from Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) either externally via representation alignment or internally by jointly modeling only a narrow slice of VFM features inside the diffusion process, under-utilizing the rich, nonlinear, multi-layer spatial semantics available. We introduce REGLUE (Representation Entanglement with Global-Local Unified Encoding), a unified latent diffusion framework that jointly models (i) VAE image latents, (ii) compact local (patch-level) VFM semantics, and (iii) a global (image-level) [CLS] token within a single SiT backbone. A lightweight convolutional semantic compressor nonlinearly aggregates multi-layer VFM features into a low-dimensional, spatially structured representation, which is entangled with the VAE latents in the diffusion process. An external alignment loss further regularizes internal representations toward frozen VFM targets. On ImageNet 256x256, REGLUE consistently improves FID and accelerates convergence over SiT-B/2 and SiT-XL/2 baselines, as well as over REPA, ReDi, and REG. Extensive experiments show that (a) spatial VFM semantics are crucial, (b) non-linear compression is key to unlocking their full benefit, and (c) global tokens and external alignment act as complementary, lightweight enhancements within our global-local-latent joint modeling framework.

While recent diffusion-based approaches show promise for G-buffer-conditioned image synthesis, they face critical limitations: single-image models like RGBX generate frames independently without temporal consistency, while video models like DiffusionRenderer are too computationally expensive for most consumer gaming sets ups and require complete sequences upfront, making them unsuitable for interactive applications where future frames depend on user input. We introduce FrameDiffuser, an autoregressive neural rendering framework that generates temporally consistent, photorealistic frames by conditioning on G-buffer data and the models own previous output. After an initial frame, FrameDiffuser operates purely on incoming G-buffer data, comprising geometry, materials, and surface properties, while using its previously generated frame for temporal guidance, maintaining stable, temporal consistent generation over hundreds to thousands of frames. Our dual-conditioning architecture combines ControlNet for structural guidance with ControlLoRA for temporal coherence. A three-stage training strategy enables stable autoregressive generation.

The model achieves high Mean- Recall-@-K scores: 99.10% (20-way 1-shot) and 90.06% (500-way 5-shot) on ChestXray-14; 99.20% (20-way 1-shot) and 98.86% (100-way 3-shot) on BraTS- 2021.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u4f7f\u7528\u4e3b\u9898\u6307\u7eb9\u8bc6\u522b\u6280\u672f\u89e3\u51b3\u5f00\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5408\u5e76\u65f6\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6cc4\u9732\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u540c\u4e00\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u7684\u6240\u6709\u56fe\u50cf\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u5339\u914d\u7684\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u91cd\u8bc6\u522b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5408\u5e76\u5f00\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u65f6\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u540c\u4e00\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u51fa\u73b0\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6570\u636e\u6cc4\u9732\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5938\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u907f\u514d\u8fd9\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u6cc4\u9732\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528ResNet-50\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u8fb9\u754c\u635f\u5931\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e3b\u9898\u6307\u7eb9\u8bc6\u522b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u540c\u4e00\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u7684\u6240\u6709\u56fe\u50cf\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u5339\u914d\u8fdb\u884c\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u91cd\u8bc6\u522b\u3002\u57283D MRI\u548c2D X-ray\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u6307\u7eb9\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6807\u51c6\uff0820-way 1-shot\uff09\u548c\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff081000-way 1-shot\uff09\u573a\u666f\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728ChestXray-14\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u9ad8Mean-Recall-@-K\u5206\u6570\uff1a99.10%\uff0820-way 1-shot\uff09\u548c90.06%\uff08500-way 5-shot\uff09\uff1b\u5728BraTS-2021\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f9799.20%\uff0820-way 1-shot\uff09\u548c98.86%\uff08100-way 3-shot\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3b\u9898\u6307\u7eb9\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5f00\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5408\u5e76\u65f6\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6cc4\u9732\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u91cd\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u3002"}}

Splatting-based methods such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) provide faster rendering by rasterizing 3D primitives. RadiantFoam (RF) brought ray tracing back, achieving throughput comparable to Gaussian Splatting by organizing radiance with an explicit Voronoi Diagram (VD). Yet, all the mentioned methods still struggle with precise mesh reconstruction. We address this gap by jointly learning an explicit VD with an implicit Signed Distance Field (SDF). The scene is optimized via ray tracing and regularized by an Eikonal objective. The SDF introduces metric-consistent isosurfaces, which, in turn, bias near-surface Voronoi cell faces to align with the zero level set. The resulting model produces crisper, view-consistent surfaces with fewer floaters and improved topology, while preserving photometric quality and maintaining training speed on par with RadiantFoam.

Manual landmarking is time-consuming, operator-dependent, and sensitive to variability across scanners and sites, limiting the reproducibility of automated approaches. There is a need for multi-source annotated datasets to develop artificial intelligence-assisted fetal growth assessment methods. To address this bottleneck, we present an open, multi-centre, multi-device benchmark dataset of fetal US images with expert anatomical landmark annotations for clinically used fetal biometric measurements. These measurements include head bi-parietal and occipito-frontal diameters, abdominal transverse and antero-posterior diameters, and femoral length. The dataset contains 4,513 de-identified US images from 1,904 subjects acquired at three clinical sites using seven different US devices. We provide standardised, subject-disjoint train/test splits, evaluation code, and baseline results to enable fair and reproducible comparison of methods. Using an automatic biometry model, we quantify domain shift and demonstrate that training and evaluation confined to a single centre substantially overestimate performance relative to multi-centre testing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first publicly available multi-centre, multi-device, landmark-annotated dataset that covers all primary fetal biometry measures, providing a robust benchmark for domain adaptation and multi-centre generalisation in fetal biometry and enabling more reliable AI-assisted fetal growth assessment across centres.

However, the complexity of semantic mask control and the uncertainty of sampling quality often limit the utility of synthetic data in downstream semantic segmentation tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a task-oriented data synthesis framework (TODSynth), including a Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MM-DiT) with unified triple attention and a plug-and-play sampling strategy guided by task feedback. Built upon the powerful DiT-based generative foundation model, we systematically evaluate different control schemes, showing that a text-image-mask joint attention scheme combined with full fine-tuning of the image and mask branches significantly enhances the effectiveness of RS semantic segmentation data synthesis, particularly in few-shot and complex-scene scenarios. Furthermore, we propose a control-rectify flow matching (CRFM) method, which dynamically adjusts sampling directions guided by semantic loss during the early high-plasticity stage, mitigating the instability of generated images and bridging the gap between synthetic data and downstream segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art controllable generation methods, producing more stable and task-oriented synthetic data for RS semantic segmentation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faTODSynth\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u53cd\u9988\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9065\u611f\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u548c\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u9065\u611f\u9886\u57df\u9700\u8981\u6269\u5c55\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u53ef\u63a7\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u63a9\u7801\u63a7\u5236\u590d\u6742\u548c\u91c7\u6837\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u7528\u3002", "method": "1. \u63d0\u51faTODSynth\u6846\u67b6\uff1b2. \u8bbe\u8ba1\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\uff08MM-DiT\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6587\u672c-\u56fe\u50cf-\u63a9\u7801\u8054\u5408\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff1b3. \u63d0\u51fa\u63a7\u5236-\u6821\u6b63\u6d41\u5339\u914d\uff08CRFM\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u91c7\u6837\u65e9\u671f\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u635f\u5931\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9065\u611f\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u548c\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "TODSynth\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u53cd\u9988\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9065\u611f\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u6269\u5c55\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, existing methods like auto-rigging and pose-conditioned generation often struggle with challenges such as inaccurate skinning weight prediction, topological imperfections, and poor pose conformance, limiting their robustness and generalizability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Make-It-Poseable, a novel feed-forward framework that reformulates character posing as a latent-space transformation problem. Instead of deforming mesh vertices as in traditional pipelines, our method reconstructs the character in new poses by directly manipulating its latent representation. At the core of our method is a latent posing transformer that manipulates shape tokens based on skeletal motion. This process is facilitated by a dense pose representation for precise control. To ensure high-fidelity geometry and accommodate topological changes, we also introduce a latent-space supervision strategy and an adaptive completion module. Our method demonstrates superior performance in posing quality.

Bridges", "Simon Hadfield"], "title": "FlowDet: Unifying Object Detection and Generative Transport Flows", "comment": null, "summary": "We present FlowDet, the first formulation of object detection using modern Conditional Flow Matching techniques. This work follows from DiffusionDet, which originally framed detection as a generative denoising problem in the bounding box space via diffusion. We revisit and generalise this formulation to a broader class of generative transport problems, while maintaining the ability to vary the number of boxes and inference steps without re-training. In contrast to the curved stochastic transport paths induced by diffusion, FlowDet learns simpler and straighter paths resulting in faster scaling of detection performance as the number of inference steps grows. We find that this reformulation enables us to outperform diffusion based detection systems (as well as non-generative baselines) across a wide range of experiments, including various precision/recall operating points using multiple feature backbones and datasets. In particular, when evaluating under recall-constrained settings, we can highlight the effects of the generative transport without over-compensating with large numbers of proposals.

However, it is challenging to reconstruct realistic and diverse full-body poses based on sparse signals obtained by head-mounted displays, which are the main devices in AR/VR scenarios. Existing methods for pose reconstruction often incur high computational costs or rely on separately modeling spatial and temporal dependencies, making it difficult to balance accuracy, temporal coherence, and efficiency. To address this problem, we propose KineST, a novel kinematics-guided state space model, which effectively extracts spatiotemporal dependencies while integrating local and global pose perception. The innovation comes from two core ideas. Firstly, in order to better capture intricate joint relationships, the scanning strategy within the State Space Duality framework is reformulated into kinematics-guided bidirectional scanning, which embeds kinematic priors. Secondly, a mixed spatiotemporal representation learning approach is employed to tightly couple spatial and temporal contexts, balancing accuracy and smoothness. Additionally, a geometric angular velocity loss is introduced to impose physically meaningful constraints on rotational variations for further improving motion stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KineST has superior performance in both accuracy and temporal consistency within a lightweight framework.

However, deploying VLLMs for downstream tasks such as video recommendation remains challenging, since real systems require multi-video inputs, lightweight backbones, low-latency sequential inference, and rapid response. In practice, (1) decode-only generation yields high latency for sequential inference, (2) typical interfaces do not support multi-video inputs, and (3) constraining outputs to language discards fine-grained visual details that matter for downstream vision tasks. We argue that these limitations stem from the absence of a representation that preserves pixel-level detail while leveraging world knowledge. We present LinkedOut, a representation that extracts VLLM world knowledge directly from video to enable fast inference, supports multi-video histories, and removes the language bottleneck. LinkedOut extracts semantically grounded, knowledge-aware tokens from raw frames using VLLMs, guided by promptable queries and optional auxiliary modalities. We introduce a cross-layer knowledge fusion MoE that selects the appropriate level of abstraction from the rich VLLM features, enabling personalized, interpretable, and low-latency recommendation. To our knowledge, LinkedOut is the first VLLM-based video recommendation method that operates on raw frames without handcrafted labels, achieving state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks. Interpretability studies and ablations confirm the benefits of layer diversity and layer-wise fusion, pointing to a practical path that fully leverages VLLM world-knowledge priors and visual reasoning for downstream vision tasks such as recommendation.", "AI": {"tldr": "LinkedOut\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ece\u89c6\u9891\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u4e16\u754c\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89c6\u9891\u63a8\u8350\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfVLLM\u5728\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u591a\u89c6\u9891\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u7ec6\u8282\u4e22\u5931\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u9891\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u90e8\u7f72\u5230\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u5982\u89c6\u9891\u63a8\u8350\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u89e3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u5178\u578b\u63a5\u53e3\u4e0d\u652f\u6301\u591a\u89c6\u9891\u8f93\u5165\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u8f93\u51fa\u4e22\u5f03\u4e86\u7cbe\u7ec6\u89c6\u89c9\u7ec6\u8282\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9650\u5236\u6e90\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u65e2\u80fd\u4fdd\u7559\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u7ec6\u8282\u53c8\u80fd\u5229\u7528\u4e16\u754c\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "LinkedOut\u4ece\u539f\u59cb\u89c6\u9891\u5e27\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u8bed\u4e49\u57fa\u7840\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u611f\u77e5\u7684token\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u63d0\u793a\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u53ef\u9009\u8f85\u52a9\u6a21\u6001\u5f15\u5bfcVLLM\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u8de8\u5c42\u77e5\u8bc6\u878d\u5408MoE\uff08\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\uff09\u9009\u62e9VLLM\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u9002\u5f53\u62bd\u8c61\u5c42\u6b21\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u63a8\u8350\u3002", "result": "LinkedOut\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eVLLM\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u624b\u5de5\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u63a8\u8350\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u5c42\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u878d\u5408\u7684\u76ca\u5904\u3002", "conclusion": "LinkedOut\u4e3a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528VLLM\u4e16\u754c\u77e5\u8bc6\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0b\u6e38\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u63a8\u8350\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86VLLM\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u5173\u952e\u9650\u5236\u3002"}}
