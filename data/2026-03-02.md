Abstract: Graphic layouts serve as an important and engaging medium for visual communication across different channels. While recent layout generation models have demonstrated impressive capabilities, they frequently fail to align with nuanced human aesthetic judgment. Existing preference datasets and reward models trained on text-to-image generation do not generalize to layout evaluation, where the spatial arrangement of identical elements determines quality. To address this critical gap, we introduce DesignSense-10k, a large-scale dataset of 10,235 human-annotated preference pairs for graphic layout evaluation. We propose a five-stage curation pipeline that generates visually coherent layout transformations across diverse aspect ratios, using semantic grouping, layout prediction, filtering, clustering, and VLM-based refinement to produce high-quality comparison pairs. Human preferences are annotated using a 4-class scheme (left, right, both good, both bad) to capture subjective ambiguity. Leveraging this dataset, we train DesignSense, a vision-language model-based classifier that substantially outperforms existing open-source and proprietary models across comprehensive evaluation metrics (54.6% improvement in Macro F1 over the strongest proprietary baseline). Our analysis shows that frontier VLMs remain unreliable overall and fail catastrophically on the full four-class task, underscoring the need for specialized, preference-aware models. Beyond the dataset, our reward model DesignSense yields tangible downstream gains in layout generation. Using our judge during RL based training improves generator win rate by about 3%, while inference-time scaling, which involves generating multiple candidates and selecting the best one, provides a 3.6% improvement. These results highlight the practical impact of specialized, layout-aware preference modeling on real-world layout generation quality.

Abstract: Limitations on the availability of Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS) present a fundamental challenge to researchers of neuromorphic computer vision applications. In response, datasets have been created by the research community, but often contain a limited number of samples or scenarios. To address the lack of a comprehensive simulator of neuromorphic vision datasets, we introduce the Anomalous Neuromorphic Tool for Shapes (ANTShapes), a novel dataset simulation framework. Built in the Unity engine, ANTShapes simulates abstract, configurable 3D scenes populated by objects displaying randomly-generated behaviours describing attributes such as motion and rotation. The sampling of object behaviours, and the labelling of anomalously-acting objects, is a statistical process following central limit theorem principles. Datasets containing an arbitrary number of samples can be created and exported from ANTShapes, along with accompanying label and frame data, through the adjustment of a limited number of parameters within the software. ANTShapes addresses the limitations of data availability to researchers of event-based computer vision by allowing for the simulation of bespoke datasets to suit purposes including object recognition and localisation alongside anomaly detection.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of deepfake technology, malicious face manipulations pose a significant threat to personal privacy and social security. However, existing proactive forensics methods typically treat deepfake detection, tampering localization, and source tracing as independent tasks, lacking a unified framework to address them jointly. To bridge this gap, we propose a unified proactive forensics framework that jointly addresses these three core tasks. Our core framework adopts an innovative 152-dimensional landmark-identity watermark termed LIDMark, which structurally interweaves facial landmarks with a unique source identifier. To robustly extract the LIDMark, we design a novel Factorized-Head Decoder (FHD). Its architecture factorizes the shared backbone features into two specialized heads (i.e., regression and classification), robustly reconstructing the embedded landmarks and identifier, respectively, even when subjected to severe distortion or tampering. This design realizes an "all-in-one" trifunctional forensic solution: the regression head underlies an "intrinsic-extrinsic" consistency check for detection and localization, while the classification head robustly decodes the source identifier for tracing. Extensive experiments show that the proposed LIDMark framework provides a unified, robust, and imperceptible solution for the detection, localization, and tracing of deepfake content. The code is available at https://github.com/vpsg-research/LIDMark.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We introduce Synthetic Visual Genome 2 (SVG2), a large-scale panoptic video scene graph dataset. SVG2 contains over 636K videos with 6.6M objects, 52.0M attributes, and 6.7M relations, providing an order-of-magnitude increase in scale and diversity over prior spatio-temporal scene graph datasets. To create SVG2, we design a fully automated pipeline that combines multi-scale panoptic segmentation, online-offline trajectory tracking with automatic new-object discovery, per-trajectory semantic parsing, and GPT-5-based spatio-temporal relation inference. Building on this resource, we train TRaSER, a video scene graph generation model. TRaSER augments VLMs with a trajectory-aligned token arrangement mechanism and new modules: an object-trajectory resampler and a temporal-window resampler to convert raw videos and panoptic trajectories into compact spatio-temporal scene graphs in a single forward pass. The temporal-window resampler binds visual tokens to short trajectory segments to preserve local motion and temporal semantics, while the object-trajectory resampler aggregates entire trajectories to maintain global context for objects. On the PVSG, VIPSeg, VidOR and SVG2 test datasets, TRaSER improves relation detection by +15 to 20%, object prediction by +30 to 40% over the strongest open-source baselines and by +13% over GPT-5, and attribute prediction by +15%. When TRaSER's generated scene graphs are sent to a VLM for video question answering, it delivers a +1.5 to 4.6% absolute accuracy gain over using video only or video augmented with Qwen2.5-VL's generated scene graphs, demonstrating the utility of explicit spatio-temporal scene graphs as an intermediate representation.

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic approaches to long-form video question answering (LVQA) have demonstrated significant accuracy improvements by grounding temporal reasoning in formal verification. However, existing methods incur prohibitive latency overheads, up to 90x slower than base VLM prompting, rendering them impractical for latency-sensitive edge deployments. We present LE-NeuS, a latency-efficient neuro-symbolic framework that preserves the accuracy benefits of temporal logic-guided video understanding while drastically reducing inference latency. Our key insight is that the dominant computational bottleneck arises from sequential and dense proposition detection across video frames during automaton construction. We address this through two principled optimizations: (1) CLIP guided two-stage adaptive sampling that exploits visual redundancy to skip semantically similar frames while preserving temporal boundaries, and (2) batched proposition detection that parallelizes VLM inference across temporal windows. Theoretically, we derive latency bounds as a function of video length, proposition complexity, and sampling density, establishing conditions under which latency efficiency is achievable. Empirically, on LongVideoBench and Video-MME benchmarks deployed on NVIDIA H100 GPUs, LE-NeuS reduces the latency gap from 90x to approximately 10x while maintaining >10% accuracy gains on temporally complex queries.

Abstract: We present the first study of cross-sensor view synthesis across different modalities. We examine a practical, fundamental, yet widely overlooked problem: getting aligned RGB-X data, where most RGB-X prior work assumes such pairs exist and focuses on modality fusion, but it empirically requires huge engineering effort in calibration. We propose a match-densify-consolidate method. First, we perform RGB-X image matching followed by guided point densification. Using the proposed confidence-aware densification and self-matching filtering, we attain better view synthesis and later consolidate them in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Our method uses no 3D priors for X-sensor and only assumes nearly no-cost COLMAP for RGB. We aim to remove the cumbersome calibration for various RGB-X sensors and advance the popularity of cross-sensor learning by a scalable solution that breaks through the bottleneck in large-scale real-world RGB-X data collection.

Abstract: Understanding sources of uncertainty is fundamental to trustworthy three-dimensional scene modeling. While recent advances in neural radiance fields (NeRFs) achieve impressive accuracy in scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis, the lack of uncertainty estimation significantly limits their deployment in safety-critical settings. Existing uncertainty quantification methods for NeRFs fail to capture both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. Among those that do quantify one or the other, many of them either compromise rendering quality or incur significant computational overhead to obtain uncertainty estimates. To address these issues, we introduce Evidential Neural Radiance Fields, a probabilistic approach that seamlessly integrates with the NeRF rendering process and enables direct quantification of both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty from a single forward pass. We compare multiple uncertainty quantification methods on three standardized benchmarks, where our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art scene reconstruction fidelity and uncertainty estimation quality.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Transforming image features from perspective view (PV) space to bird's-eye-view (BEV) space remains challenging in autonomous driving due to depth ambiguity and occlusion. Although several view transformation (VT) paradigms have been proposed, the challenge still remains. In this paper, we propose a new regularization framework, dubbed CycleBEV, that enhances existing VT models for BEV semantic segmentation. Inspired by cycle consistency, widely used in image distribution modeling, we devise an inverse view transformation (IVT) network that maps BEV segmentation maps back to PV segmentation maps and use it to regularize VT networks during training through cycle consistency losses, enabling them to capture richer semantic and geometric information from input PV images. To further exploit the capacity of the IVT network, we introduce two novel ideas that extend cycle consistency into geometric and representation spaces. We evaluate CycleBEV on four representative VT models covering three major paradigms using the large-scale nuScenes dataset. Experimental results show consistent improvements -- with gains of up to 0.74, 4.86, and 3.74 mIoU for drivable area, vehicle, and pedestrian classes, respectively -- without increasing inference complexity, since the IVT network is used only during training. The implementation code is available at https://github.com/JeongbinHong/CycleBEV.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large unimodal foundation models for vision and language encode rich semantic structures, yet aligning them typically requires computationally intensive multimodal fine-tuning. Such approaches depend on large-scale parameter updates, are resource intensive, and can perturb pretrained representations. Emerging evidence suggests, however, that independently trained foundation models may already exhibit latent semantic compatibility, reflecting shared structures in the data they model. This raises a fundamental question: can cross-modal alignment be achieved without modifying the models themselves? Here we introduce HDFLIM (HyperDimensional computing with Frozen Language and Image Models), a framework that establishes cross-modal mappings while keeping pretrained vision and language models fully frozen. HDFLIM projects unimodal embeddings into a shared hyperdimensional space and leverages lightweight symbolic operations -- binding, bundling, and similarity-based retrieval to construct associative cross-modal representations in a single pass over the data. Caption generation emerges from high-dimensional memory retrieval rather than iterative gradient-based optimization. We show that HDFLIM achieves performance comparable to end-to-end vision-language training methods and produces captions that are more semantically grounded than zero-shot baselines. By decoupling alignment from parameter tuning, our results suggest that semantic mapping across foundation models can be realized through symbolic operations on hyperdimensional encodings of the respective embeddings. More broadly, this work points toward an alternative paradigm for foundation model alignment in which frozen models are integrated through structured representational mappings rather than through large-scale retraining. The codebase for our implementation can be found at https://github.com/Abhishek-Dalvi410/HDFLIM.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Recent multimodal models such as Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) have shown remarkable ability to align visual and linguistic representations. However, domains where small visual differences carry large semantic significance, such as diagram understanding, remain challenging due to the models' limited sensitivity to fine-grained structural variations.
  We propose a new training paradigm designed to enhance diagram comprehension in vision-language models. Our approach introduces pseudo contrastive samples generated by a diagram renderer that creates synthetic diagrams using randomly picked text elements. These samples highlight structural differences in diagrammatic imagery without requiring any modification or editing of the original data. By incorporating these pseudo contrastive samples into the training objective, the model learns to capture more precise and semantically consistent diagram structures.
  Empirical evaluations on a benchmark dataset of flowcharts demonstrate substantial improvements over standard CLIP and hard-negative CLIP training in both image-text matching and visual question answering tasks. The results underscore the value of domain-specific training strategies and contribute to advancing diagrammatic understanding within the broader context of vision-language learning.

Abstract: While nowadays visual anomaly detection algorithms use deep neural networks to extract salient features from images, the high dimensionality of extracted features makes it difficult to apply those algorithms to large data with 1000s of images. To address this issue, we present an incremental dimension reduction algorithm to reduce the extracted features. While our algorithm essentially computes truncated singular value decomposition of these features, other than processing all vectors at once, our algorithm groups the vectors into batches. At each batch, our algorithm updates the truncated singular values and vectors that represent all visited vectors, and reduces each batch by its own singular values and vectors so they can be stored in the memory with low overhead. After processing all batches, we re-transform these batch-wise singular vectors to the space spanned by the singular vectors of all features. We show that our algorithm can accelerate the training of state-of-the-art anomaly detection algorithm with close accuracy.

Abstract: Current Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) struggle with high-resolution visual inputs during the reasoning process, as the number of image tokens increases quadratically with resolution, introducing substantial redundancy and irrelevant information. A common practice is to identify key image regions and refer to their high-resolution counterparts during reasoning, typically trained with external visual supervision. However, such visual supervision cues require costly grounding labels from human annotators. Meanwhile, it remains an open question how to enhance a model's grounding abilities to support reasoning without relying on additional annotations. In this paper, we propose High-resolution Annotation-free Reasoning Technique (HART), a closed-loop framework that enables LMMs to focus on and self-verify key regions of high-resolution visual inputs. HART incorporates a post-training paradigm in which we design Advantage Preference Group Relative Policy Optimization (AP-GRPO) to encourage accurate localization of key regions. Notably, HART provides explainable reasoning pathways and enables efficient optimization of localization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HART improves performance across a wide range of high-resolution visual tasks, consistently outperforming strong baselines. When applied to post-train Qwen2.5-VL-7B, HART even surpasses larger-scale models such as Qwen2.5-VL-72B and LLaVA-OneVision-72B on high-resolution, vision-centric benchmarks.

Abstract: Egocentric human pose estimation (HPE) using a head-mounted device is crucial for various VR and AR applications, but it faces significant challenges due to keypoint invisibility. Nevertheless, none of the existing egocentric HPE datasets provide keypoint visibility annotations, and the existing methods often overlook the invisibility problem, treating visible and invisible keypoints indiscriminately during estimation. As a result, their capacity to accurately predict visible keypoints is compromised. In this paper, we first present Eva-3M, a large-scale egocentric visibility-aware HPE dataset comprising over 3.0M frames, with 435K of them annotated with keypoint visibility labels. Additionally, we augment the existing EMHI dataset with keypoint visibility annotations to further facilitate the research in this direction. Furthermore, we propose EvaPose, a novel egocentric visibility-aware HPE method that explicitly incorporates visibility information to enhance pose estimation accuracy. Extensive experiments validate the significant value of ground-truth visibility labels in egocentric HPE settings, and demonstrate that our EvaPose achieves state-of-the-art performance in both Eva-3M and EMHI datasets.

Abstract: Significant progress has been made in the field of Instruction-based Image Editing Models (IIEMs). However, while these models demonstrate plausible adherence to instructions and strong reasoning ability on current benchmarks, their ability to edit small objects remains underexplored, despite its importance for precise local editing and refining details in both real and generated images. In this paper, we introduce DeepLookEditBench (DLEBench), the first benchmark dedicated to assessing the abilities of IIEMs in editing small-scale objects. Specifically, we construct a challenging testbed comprising 1889 samples across seven instruction types. In these samples, target objects occupy only 1%-10% of the image area, covering complex scenarios such as partial occlusion and multi-object editing. To ensure robust evaluation on this benchmark, we propose an evaluation protocol with refined score rubrics to minimize subjectivity and ambiguity in two criteria: Instruction Following and Visual Consistency. This protocol also introduces a dual-mode evaluation framework (Tool-driven and Oracle-guided Modes) addressing the misalignment between LMM-as-a-Judge and human judgements on DLEBench. Empirical results on 10 IIEMs reveal significant performance gaps in small-scale object editing, highlighting the need for specialized benchmarks to advance this ability.

Abstract: We introduce BuildAnyPoint, a novel generative framework for structured 3D building reconstruction from point clouds with diverse distributions, such as those captured by airborne LiDAR and Structure-from-Motion. To recover artist-created building abstraction in this highly underconstrained setting, we capitalize on the role of explicit 3D generative priors in autoregressive mesh generation. Specifically, we design a Loosely Cascaded Diffusion Transformer (Loca-DiT) that initially recovers the underlying distribution from noisy or sparse points, followed by autoregressively encapsulating them into compact meshes. We first formulate distribution recovery as a conditional generation task by training latent diffusion models conditioned on input point clouds, and then tailor a decoder-only transformer for conditional autoregressive mesh generation based on the recovered point clouds. Our method delivers substantial qualitative and quantitative improvements over prior building abstraction methods. Furthermore, the effectiveness of our approach is evidenced by the strong performance of its recovered point clouds on building point cloud completion benchmarks, which exhibit improved surface accuracy and distribution uniformity.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) show strong potential for complex diagnostic tasks in medical imaging. However, applying VLMs to multi-organ medical imaging introduces two principal challenges: (1) modality-specific vision-language alignment and (2) cross-modal feature fusion. In this work, we propose MedMAP, a Medical Modality-Aware Pretraining framework that enhances vision-language representation learning in 3D MRI. MedMAP comprises a modality-aware vision-language alignment stage and a fine-tuning stage for multi-organ abnormality detection. During the pre-training stage, the modality-aware encoders implicitly capture the joint modality distribution and improve alignment between visual and textual representations. We then fine-tune the pre-trained vision encoders (while keeping the text encoder frozen) for downstream tasks. To this end, we curated MedMoM-MRI3D, comprising 7,392 3D MRI volume-report pairs spanning twelve MRI modalities and nine abnormalities tailored for various 3D medical analysis tasks. Extensive experiments on MedMoM-MRI3D demonstrate that MedMAP significantly outperforms existing VLMs in 3D MRI-based multi-organ abnormality detection.

Abstract: Large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit strong zero-shot recognition, yet their real-world deployment is challenged by distribution shifts. While Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) can mitigate this, existing VLM-based TTA methods operate under a closed-set assumption, failing in open-set scenarios where test streams contain both covariate-shifted in-distribution (csID) and out-of-distribution (csOOD) data. This leads to a critical difficulty: the model must discriminate unknown csOOD samples to avoid interference while simultaneously adapting to known csID classes for accuracy. Current open-set TTA (OSTTA) methods rely on hard thresholds for separation and entropy minimization for adaptation. These strategies are brittle, often misclassifying ambiguous csOOD samples and inducing overconfident predictions, and their parameter-update mechanism is computationally prohibitive for VLMs. To address these limitations, we propose Prototype-based Double-Check Separation (ProtoDCS), a robust framework for OSTTA that effectively separates csID and csOOD samples, enabling safe and efficient adaptation of VLMs to csID data. Our main contributions are: (1) a novel double-check separation mechanism employing probabilistic Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) verification to replace brittle thresholding; and (2) an evidence-driven adaptation strategy utilizing uncertainty-aware loss and efficient prototype-level updates, mitigating overconfidence and reducing computational overhead. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10/100-C and Tiny-ImageNet-C demonstrate that ProtoDCS achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly boosting both known-class accuracy and OOD detection metrics.

Abstract: Automated radiology report generation using vision-language models (VLMs) is limited by the risk of prior-comparison hallucination, where the model generates historical findings unsupported by the current study. We address this challenge with a training-free, inference-time control framework termed Semantically Decoupled Latent Steering (SDLS). Unlike generic activation steering, which often suffers from semantic entanglement, our approach constructs a semantic-free intervention vector via large language model (LLM)-driven semantic decomposition followed by $QR$-based orthogonalization. This orthogonalization step is critical. It leverages geometric constraints to filter out the clinical semantics often entangled in standard principal component analysis (PCA) directions, ensuring that the steering vector targets only the ``historical comparison" axis. We validate our method on the BiomedGPT foundation model, demonstrating that it overcomes the trade-off between hallucination suppression and clinical accuracy. Extensive experiments on MIMIC-CXR, and zero-shot transfer evaluation on CheXpert Plus and IU-Xray, demonstrate the robustness of our approach. Quantitative evaluations on MIMIC-CXR show that our approach significantly reduces the probability of historical hallucinations (FilBERT score decreases from 0.2373 to 0.1889) and improves clinical label fidelity (CheXpert macro-F1 increases from 0.2242 to 0.3208). Supplementary evaluations confirm that the structural integrity of the clinical narrative is maintained.

Abstract: Fine-grained crop-weed segmentation is essential for enabling targeted herbicide application in precision agriculture. However, existing deep learning models struggle to generalize across heterogeneous agricultural environments due to reliance on dataset-specific visual features. We propose Vision-Language Weed Segmentation (VL-WS), a novel framework that addresses this limitation by grounding pixel-level segmentation in semantically aligned, domain-invariant representations. Our architecture employs a dual-encoder design, where frozen Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) embeddings and task-specific spatial features are fused and modulated via Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) layers conditioned on natural language captions. This design enables image level textual descriptions to guide channel-wise feature refinement while preserving fine-grained spatial localization. Unlike prior works restricted to training and evaluation on single-source datasets, VL-WS is trained on a unified corpus that includes close-range ground imagery (robotic platforms) and high-altitude UAV imagery, covering diverse crop types, weed species, growth stages, and sensing conditions. Experimental results across four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, with VL-WS achieving a mean Dice score of 91.64% and outperforming the CNN baseline by 4.98%. The largest gains occur on the most challenging weed class, where VL-WS attains 80.45% Dice score compared to 65.03% for the best baseline, representing a 15.42% improvement. VL-WS further maintains stable weed segmentation performance under limited target-domain supervision, indicating improved generalization and data efficiency. These findings highlight the potential of vision-language alignment to enable scalable, label-efficient segmentation models deployable across diverse real-world agricultural domains.

Abstract: The remote sensing community is witnessing a rapid growth of foundation models, which provide powerful embeddings for a wide range of downstream tasks. However, practical adoption and fair comparison remain challenging due to substantial heterogeneity in model release formats, platforms and interfaces, and input data specifications. These inconsistencies significantly increase the cost of obtaining, using, and benchmarking embeddings across models. To address this issue, we propose rs-embed, a Python library that offers a unified, region of interst (ROI) centric interface: with a single line of code, users can retrieve embeddings from any supported model for any location and any time range. The library also provides efficient batch processing to enable large-scale embedding generation and evaluation. The code is available at: https://github.com/cybergis/rs-embed

Abstract: Object swapping aims to replace a source object in a scene with a reference object while preserving object fidelity, scene fidelity, and object-scene harmony. Existing methods either require per-object finetuning and slow inference or rely on extra paired data that mostly depict the same object across contexts, forcing models to rely on background cues rather than learning cross-object alignment. We propose SourceSwap, a self-supervised and source-aware framework that learns cross-object alignment. Our key insight is to synthesize high-quality pseudo pairs from any image via a frequency-separated perturbation in the initial-noise space, which alters appearance while preserving pose, coarse shape, and scene layout, requiring no videos, multi-view data, or additional images. We then train a dual U-Net with full-source conditioning and a noise-free reference encoder, enabling direct inter-object alignment, zero-shot inference without per-object finetuning, and lightweight iterative refinement. We further introduce SourceBench, a high-quality benchmark with higher resolution, more categories, and richer interactions. Experiments demonstrate that SourceSwap achieves superior fidelity, stronger scene preservation, and more natural harmony, and it transfers well to edits such as subject-driven refinement and face swapping.

Abstract: The quadratic computational cost of processing vision tokens in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hinders their widespread adoption. While progressive vision token pruning offers a promising solution, current methods misinterpret shallow layer functions and use rigid schedules, which fail to unlock the full efficiency potential. To address these issues, we propose HiDrop, a framework that aligns token pruning with the true hierarchical function of MLLM layers. HiDrop features two key innovations: (1) Late Injection, which bypasses passive shallow layers to introduce visual tokens exactly where active fusion begins; and (2) Concave Pyramid Pruning with an Early Exit mechanism to dynamically adjust pruning rates across middle and deep layers. This process is optimized via an inter-layer similarity measure and a differentiable top-k operator. To ensure practical efficiency, HiDrop further incorporates persistent positional encoding, FlashAttention-compatible token selection, and parallel decoupling of vision computation to eliminate hidden overhead associated with dynamic token reduction. Extensive experiments show that HiDrop compresses about 90% visual tokens while matching the original performance and accelerating training by 1.72 times. Our work not only sets a new state-of-the-art for efficient MLLM training and inference but also provides valuable insights into the hierarchical nature of multimodal fusion. The code is released at https://github.com/EIT-NLP/HiDrop.

Abstract: Ultra-long egocentric videos spanning multiple days present significant challenges for video understanding. Existing approaches still rely on fragmented local processing and limited temporal modeling, restricting their ability to reason over such extended sequences. To address these limitations, we introduce EgoGraph, a training-free and dynamic knowledge-graph construction framework that explicitly encodes long-term, cross-entity dependencies in egocentric video streams. EgoGraph employs a novel egocentric schema that unifies the extraction and abstraction of core entities, such as people, objects, locations, and events, and structurally reasons about their attributes and interactions, yielding a significantly richer and more coherent semantic representation than traditional clip-based video models. Crucially, we develop a temporal relational modeling strategy that captures temporal dependencies across entities and accumulates stable long-term memory over multiple days, enabling complex temporal reasoning. Extensive experiments on the EgoLifeQA and EgoR1-bench benchmarks demonstrate that EgoGraph achieves state-of-the-art performance on long-term video question answering, validating its effectiveness as a new paradigm for ultra-long egocentric video understanding.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Unified Multimodal Large Language Models (U-MLLMs) integrate understanding and generation within a single architecture. However, existing evaluations typically assess these capabilities separately, overlooking semantic equivalence, i.e., the ability to manifest consistent reasoning results regardless of the output modality. In this work, we investigate whether current U-MLLMs satisfy this premise. We observe that while models demonstrate robust textual reasoning, they fail to maintain semantic equivalence when required to render the same results in the image modality. To rigorously diagnose this discrepancy, we introduce VGUBench, a framework to decouple reasoning logic from generation fidelity. VGUBench comprises three diagnostic tasks: (1)Textual Generative Understanding, establishing a baseline for reasoning accuracy in textual response; (2)Visual Generative Understanding, evaluating the ability to generate visual responses that represent the correct answer; and (3)a Visual Rendering control task, which assesses the ability to directly render explicit visual descriptions into images without complex reasoning. Our evaluation reveals a significant disparity: despite strong performance in textual understanding and visual rendering, U-MLLMs exhibit a marked performance collapse when required to generate visual answers to questions. Furthermore, we find a negligible correlation between visual answering performance and basic rendering quality. These results suggest that the failure stems not from insufficient generation fidelity, but from a breakdown in cross-modal semantic alignment. We provide diagnostic insights to address this challenge in future Unified Generation and Understanding Models.

Abstract: Diffusion models are able to produce AI-generated images that are almost indistinguishable from real ones. This raises concerns about their potential misuse and poses substantial challenges for detecting them. Many existing detectors rely on reconstruction error -- the difference between the input image and its reconstructed version -- as the basis for distinguishing real from fake images. However, these detectors become less effective as modern AI-generated images become increasingly similar to real ones. To address this challenge, we propose a novel difference-in-difference method. Instead of directly using the reconstruction error (a first-order difference), we compute the difference in reconstruction error -- a second-order difference -- for variance reduction and improving detection accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves strong generalization performance, enabling reliable detection of AI-generated images in the era of generative AI.

Abstract: One-stream Transformer-based trackers achieve advanced performance in visual object tracking but suffer from significant computational overhead that hinders real-time deployment. While token pruning offers a path to efficiency, existing methods are fragmented. They typically prune the search region, dynamic template, and static template in isolation, overlooking critical inter-component dependencies, which yields suboptimal pruning and degraded accuracy. To address this, we introduce UTPTrack, a simple and Unified Token Pruning framework that, for the first time, jointly compresses all three components. UTPTrack employs an attention-guided, token type-aware strategy to holistically model redundancy, a design that seamlessly supports unified tracking across multimodal and language-guided tasks within a single model. Extensive evaluations on 10 benchmarks demonstrate that UTPTrack achieves a new state-of-the-art in the accuracy-efficiency trade-off for pruning-based trackers, pruning 65.4% of vision tokens in RGB-based tracking and 67.5% in unified tracking while preserving 99.7% and 100.5% of baseline performance, respectively. This strong performance across both RGB and multimodal scenarios underlines its potential as a robust foundation for future research in efficient visual tracking. Code will be released at https://github.com/EIT-NLP/UTPTrack.

Abstract: Full-stack multimodal interaction in real-time is a central goal in building intelligent embodied agents capable of natural, dynamic communication. However, existing systems are either limited to unimodal generation or suffer from degraded reasoning and poor cross-modal alignment, preventing coherent and perceptually grounded interactions. In this work, we introduce U-Mind, the first unified system for high-intelligence multimodal dialogue that supports real-time generation and jointly models language, speech, motion, and video synthesis within a single interactive loop. At its core, U-Mind implements a Unified Alignment and Reasoning Framework that addresses two key challenges: enhancing cross-modal synchronization via a segment-wise alignment strategy, and preserving reasoning abilities through Rehearsal-Driven Learning. During inference, U-Mind adopts a text-first decoding pipeline that performs internal chain-of-thought planning followed by temporally synchronized generation across modalities. To close the loop, we implement a real-time video rendering framework conditioned on pose and speech, enabling expressive and synchronized visual feedback. Extensive experiments demonstrate that U-Mind achieves state-of-the-art performance on a range of multimodal interaction tasks, including question answering, instruction following, and motion generation, paving the way toward intelligent, immersive conversational agents.

Abstract: Accurately segmenting objects without any manual annotations remains one of the core challenges in computer vision. In this work, we introduce Selfment, a fully self-supervised framework that segments foreground objects directly from raw images without human labels, pretrained segmentation models, or any post-processing. Selfment first constructs patch-level affinity graphs from self-supervised features and applies NCut to obtain an initial coarse foreground--background separation. We then introduce Iterative Patch Optimization (IPO), a feature-space refinement procedure that progressively enforces spatial coherence and semantic consistency through iterative patch clustering. The refined masks are subsequently used as supervisory signals to train a lightweight segmentation head with contrastive and region-consistency objectives, allowing the model to learn stable and transferable object representations. Despite its simplicity and complete absence of manual supervision, Selfment sets new state-of-the-art (SoTA) results across multiple benchmarks. It achieves substantial improvements on $F_{\max}$ over previous unsupervised saliency detection methods on ECSSD ($+4.0\%$), HKUIS ($+4.6\%$), and PASCAL-S ($+5.7\%$). Moreover, without any additional fine-tuning, Selfment demonstrates remarkable zero-shot generalization to camouflaged object detection tasks (e.g., $0.910$ $S_m$ on CHAMELEON and $0.792$ $F_β^ω$ on CAMO), outperforming all existing unsupervised approaches and even rivaling the SoTA fully supervised methods.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models lack an efficient mechanism for early quality assessment, leading to costly trial-and-error in multi-generation scenarios such as prompt iteration, agent-based generation, and flow-grpo. We reveal a strong correlation between early diffusion cross-attention distributions and final image quality. Based on this finding, we introduce Diffusion Probe, a framework that leverages internal cross-attention maps as predictive signals.
  We design a lightweight predictor that maps statistical properties of early-stage cross-attention extracted from initial denoising steps to the final image's overall quality. This enables accurate forecasting of image quality across diverse evaluation metrics long before full synthesis is complete.
  We validate Diffusion Probe across a wide range of settings. On multiple T2I models, across early denoising windows, resolutions, and quality metrics, it achieves strong correlation (PCC > 0.7) and high classification performance (AUC-ROC > 0.9).
  Its reliability translates into practical gains. By enabling early quality-aware decisions in workflows such as prompt optimization, seed selection, and accelerated RL training, the probe supports more targeted sampling and avoids computation on low-potential generations. This reduces computational overhead while improving final output quality.
  Diffusion Probe is model-agnostic, efficient, and broadly applicable, offering a practical solution for improving T2I generation efficiency through early quality prediction.

Abstract: In remote sensing rotated object detection, mainstream methods suffer from two bottlenecks, directional incoherence at detector neck and task conflict at detecting head. Ulitising fourier rotation equivariance, we introduce Fourier Angle Alignment, which analyses angle information through frequency spectrum and aligns the main direction to a certain orientation. Then we propose two plug and play modules : FAAFusion and FAA Head. FAAFusion works at the detector neck, aligning the main direction of higher-level features to the lower-level features and then fusing them. FAA Head serves as a new detection head, which pre-aligns RoI features to a canonical angle and adds them to the original features before classification and regression. Experiments on DOTA-v1.0, DOTA-v1.5 and HRSC2016 show that our method can greatly improve previous work. Particularly, our method achieves new state-of-the-art results of 78.72% mAP on DOTA-v1.0 and 72.28% mAP on DOTA-v1.5 datasets with single scale training and testing, validating the efficacy of our approach in remote sensing object detection.

Abstract: Pre-trained perception models excel in generic image domains but degrade significantly in novel environments like indoor scenes. The conventional remedy is fine-tuning on downstream data which incurs catastrophic forgetting of prior knowledge and demands costly, scene-specific annotations. We propose a paradigm shift through Sea$^2$ (See, Act, Adapt): rather than adapting the perception modules themselves, we adapt how they are deployed through an intelligent pose-control agent. Sea$^2$ keeps all perception modules frozen, requiring no downstream labels during training, and uses only scalar perceptual feedback to navigate the agent toward informative viewpoints. Specially, we transform a vision-language model (VLM) into a low-level pose controller through a two-stage training pipeline: first fine-tuning it on rule-based exploration trajectories that systematically probe indoor scenes, and then refining the policy via unsupervised reinforcement learning that constructs rewards from the perception module's outputs and confidence. Unlike prior active perception methods that couple exploration with specific models or collect data for retraining them, Sea$^2$ directly leverages off-the-shelf perception models for various tasks without the need for retraining. We conducted experiments on three visual perception tasks, including visual grounding, segmentation and 3D box estimation, with performance improvements of 13.54%, 15.92% and 27.68% respectively on dataset ReplicaCAD.

Abstract: Bimanual manipulation requires policies that can reason about 3D geometry, anticipate how it evolves under action, and generate smooth, coordinated motions. However, existing methods typically rely on 2D features with limited spatial awareness, or require explicit point clouds that are difficult to obtain reliably in real-world settings. At the same time, recent 3D geometric foundation models show that accurate and diverse 3D structure can be reconstructed directly from RGB images in a fast and robust manner. We leverage this opportunity and propose a framework that builds bimanual manipulation directly on a pre-trained 3D geometric foundation model. Our policy fuses geometry-aware latents, 2D semantic features, and proprioception into a unified state representation, and uses diffusion model to jointly predict a future action chunk and a future 3D latent that decodes into a dense pointmap. By explicitly predicting how the 3D scene will evolve together with the action sequence, the policy gains strong spatial understanding and predictive capability using only RGB observations. We evaluate our method both in simulation on the RoboTwin benchmark and in real-world robot executions. Our approach consistently outperforms 2D-based and point-cloud-based baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance in manipulation success, inter-arm coordination, and 3D spatial prediction accuracy.

Abstract: Rapid progress in vision-language modeling has enabled pathology report generation from gigapixel whole-slide images, but most approaches assume static training with simultaneous access to all data. In clinical deployment, however, new organs, institutions, and reporting conventions emerge over time, and sequential fine-tuning can cause catastrophic forgetting. We introduce an exemplar-free continual learning framework for WSI-to-report generation that avoids storing raw slides or patch exemplars. The core idea is a compact domain footprint built in a frozen patch-embedding space: a small codebook of representative morphology tokens together with slide-level co-occurrence summaries and lightweight patch-count priors. These footprints support generative replay by synthesizing pseudo-WSI representations that reflect domain-specific morphological mixtures, while a teacher snapshot provides pseudo-reports to supervise the updated model without retaining past data. To address shifting reporting conventions, we distill domain-specific linguistic characteristics into a compact style descriptor and use it to steer generation. At inference, the model identifies the most compatible descriptor directly from the slide signal, enabling domain-agnostic setup without requiring explicit domain identifiers. Evaluated across multiple public continual learning benchmarks, our approach outperforms exemplar-free and limited-buffer rehearsal baselines, highlighting footprint-based generative replay as a practical solution for deployment in evolving clinical settings.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of deep learning, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery has become a key modality for ship detection. However, robust performance remains challenging in complex scenes, where clutter and speckle noise can induce false alarms and small targets are easily missed. To address these issues, we propose CPN-YOLO, a high-precision ship detection framework built upon YOLOv8 with three targeted improvements. First, we introduce a learnable large-kernel denoising module for input pre-processing, producing cleaner representations and more discriminative features across diverse ship types. Second, we design a feature extraction enhancement strategy based on the PPA attention mechanism to strengthen multi-scale modeling and improve sensitivity to small ships. Third, we incorporate a Gaussian similarity loss derived from the normalized Wasserstein distance (NWD) to better measure similarity under complex bounding-box distributions and improve generalization. Extensive experiments on HRSID and SSDD demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. On SSDD, CPN-YOLO surpasses the YOLOv8 baseline, achieving 97.0% precision, 95.1% recall, and 98.9% mAP, and consistently outperforms other representative deep-learning detectors in overall performance.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Complex video reasoning, actually, relies excessively on fine-grained perception rather than on expert (e.g., Ph.D, Science)-level reasoning. Through extensive empirical observation, we have recognized the critical impact of perception. In particular, when perception ability is almost fixed, enhancing reasoning from Qwen3-8B to OpenAI-o3 yields only 0.7% performance improvement. Conversely, even minimal change in perception model scale (from 7B to 32B) boosts performance by 1.4%, indicating enhancing perception, rather than reasoning, is more critical to improve performance. Therefore, exploring how to enhance perception ability through reasoning without the need for expensive fine-grained annotation information is worthwhile. To achieve this goal, we specially propose APPO, the Attention-guided Perception Policy Optimization algorithm that leverages token-level dense rewards to improve model's fine-grained perception. The core idea behind APPO is to optimize those tokens from different responses that primarily focus on the same crucial video frame (called intra-group perception tokens). Experimental results on diverse video benchmarks and models with different scales (3/7B) demonstrate APPO consistently outperforms GRPO and DAPO (0.5%~4%). We hope our work provides a promising approach to effectively enhance model's perception abilities through reasoning in a low-cost manner, serving diverse scenarios and demands.

Abstract: To address the challenge of aerial visual place recognition (VPR) problem under significant altitude variations, this study proposes an altitude-adaptive VPR approach that integrates ground feature density analysis with image classification techniques. The proposed method estimates airborne platforms' relative altitude by analyzing the density of ground features in images, then applies relative altitude-based cropping to generate canonical query images, which are subsequently used in a classification-based VPR strategy for localization. Extensive experiments across diverse terrains and altitude conditions demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves high accuracy and robustness in both altitude estimation and VPR under significant altitude changes. Compared to conventional methods relying on barometric altimeters or Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensors, this solution requires no additional hardware and offers a plug-and-play solution for downstream applications, {making it suitable for small- and medium-sized airborne platforms operating in diverse environments, including rural and urban areas.} Under significant altitude variations, incorporating our relative altitude estimation module into the VPR retrieval pipeline boosts average R@1 and R@5 by 29.85\% and 60.20\%, respectively, compared with applying VPR retrieval alone. Furthermore, compared to traditional {Monocular Metric Depth Estimation (MMDE) methods}, the proposed method reduces the mean error by 202.1 m, yielding average additional improvements of 31.4\% in R@1 and 44\% in R@5. These results demonstrate that our method establishes a robust, vision-only framework for three-dimensional visual place recognition, offering a practical and scalable solution for accurate airborne platforms localization under large altitude variations and limited sensor availability.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose ReSeg-CLIP, a new training-free Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation method for remote sensing data. To compensate for the problems of vision language models, such as CLIP in semantic segmentation caused by inappropriate interactions within the self-attention layers, we introduce a hierarchical scheme utilizing masks generated by SAM to constrain the interactions at multiple scales. We also present a model composition approach that averages the parameters of multiple RS-specific CLIP variants, taking advantage of a new weighting scheme that evaluates representational quality using varying text prompts. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results across three RS benchmarks without additional training.

Abstract: Embodied foundation models require large-scale, high-quality real-world interaction data for pre-training and scaling. However, existing data collection methods suffer from high infrastructure costs, complex hardware dependencies, and limited interaction scope, making scalable expansion challenging. In fact, humans themselves are ideal physically embodied agents. Therefore, obtaining egocentric real-world interaction data from globally distributed "human agents" offers advantages of low cost and sustainability. To this end, we propose the Always-on Egocentric (AoE) data collection system, which aims to simplify hardware dependencies by leveraging humans themselves and their smartphones, enabling low-cost, highly efficient, and scene-agnostic real-world interaction data collection to address the challenge of data scarcity. Specifically, we first employ an ergonomic neck-mounted smartphone holder to enable low-barrier, large-scale egocentric data collection through a cloud-edge collaborative architecture. Second, we develop a cross-platform mobile APP that leverages on-device compute for real-time processing, while the cloud hosts automated labeling and filtering pipelines that transform raw videos into high-quality training data. Finally, the AoE system supports distributed Ego video data collection by anyone, anytime, and anywhere. We evaluate AoE on data preprocessing quality and downstream tasks, demonstrating that high-quality egocentric data significantly boosts real-world generalization.

Abstract: A key challenge for autonomous driving lies in maintaining real-time situational awareness regarding surrounding obstacles under strict latency constraints. The high processing requirements coupled with limited onboard computational resources can cause delay issues, particularly in complex urban settings. To address this, we propose leveraging Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication to partially offload processing to the cloud, where compute resources are abundant, thus reducing overall latency. Our approach utilizes transformer-based models to fuse multi-camera sensor data into a comprehensive Bird's-Eye View (BEV) representation, enabling accurate 360-degree 3D object detection. The computation is dynamically split between the vehicle and the cloud based on the number of layers processed locally and the quantization level of the features. To further reduce network load, we apply feature vector clipping and compression prior to transmission. In a real-world experimental evaluation, our hybrid strategy achieved a 72 \% reduction in end-to-end latency compared to a traditional onboard solution. To adapt to fluctuating network conditions, we introduce a dynamic optimization algorithm that selects the split point and quantization level to maximize detection accuracy while satisfying real-time latency constraints. Trace-based evaluation under realistic bandwidth variability shows that this adaptive approach improves accuracy by up to 20 \% over static parameterization with the same latency performance.

Abstract: Multimodal large models have shown excellent ability in addressing image super-resolution in real-world scenarios by leveraging language class as condition information, yet their abilities in degraded images remain limited. In this paper, we first revisit the capabilities of the Recognize Anything Model (RAM) for degraded images by calculating text similarity. We find that directly using contrastive learning to fine-tune RAM in the degraded space is difficult to achieve acceptable results. To address this issue, we employ a degradation selection strategy to propose a Real Embedding Extractor (REE), which achieves significant recognition performance gain on degraded image content through contrastive learning. Furthermore, we use a Conditional Feature Modulator (CFM) to incorporate the high-level information of REE for a powerful Mamba-based network, which can leverage effective pixel information to restore image textures and produce visually pleasing results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the REE can effectively help image super-resolution networks balance fidelity and perceptual quality, highlighting the great potential of Mamba in real-world applications.

Abstract: Estimating 3D occupancy and motion at the vehicle's surroundings is essential for autonomous driving, enabling situational awareness in dynamic environments. Existing approaches jointly learn geometry and motion but rely on expensive 3D occupancy and flow annotations, velocity labels from bounding boxes, or pretrained optical flow models. We propose a self-supervised method for 3D occupancy flow estimation that eliminates the need for human-produced annotations or external flow supervision. Our method disentangles the scene into separate static and dynamic signed distance fields and learns motion implicitly through temporal aggregation. Additionally, we introduce a strong self-supervised flow cue derived from features' cosine similarities. We demonstrate the efficacy of our 3D occupancy flow method on SemanticKITTI, KITTI-MOT, and nuScenes.

Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) links language to region level visual perception. Standard benchmarks (RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg) have progressed rapidly with multimodal LLMs but remain weak tests of visual reasoning and grounding: (i) many expressions are very short, leaving little reasoning demand; (ii) images often contain few distractors, making the target easy to find; and (iii) redundant descriptors enable shortcut solutions that bypass genuine text understanding and visual reasoning. We introduce Ref-Adv, a modern REC benchmark that suppresses shortcuts by pairing linguistically nontrivial expressions with only the information necessary to uniquely identify the target. The dataset contains referring expressions on real images, curated with hard distractors and annotated with reasoning facets including negation. We conduct comprehensive ablations (word order perturbations and descriptor deletion sufficiency) to show that solving Ref-Adv requires reasoning beyond simple cues, and we evaluate a broad suite of contemporary multimodal LLMs on Ref-Adv. Despite strong results on RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg, models drop markedly on Ref-Adv, revealing reliance on shortcuts and gaps in visual reasoning and grounding. We provide an in depth failure analysis and aim for Ref-Adv to guide future work on visual reasoning and grounding in MLLMs.

Abstract: We propose an experience-guided cascaded multi-agent framework for Breast Ultrasound Screening and Diagnosis, called BUSD-Agent, that aims to reduce diagnostic escalation and unnecessary biopsy referrals. Our framework models screening and diagnosis as a two-stage, selective decision-making process. A lightweight `screening clinic' agent, restricted to classification models as tools, selectively filters out benign and normal cases from further diagnostic escalation when malignancy risk and uncertainty are estimated as low. Cases that have higher risks are escalated to the `diagnostic clinic' agent, which integrates richer perception and radiological description tools to make a secondary decision on biopsy referral. To improve agent performance, past records of pathology-confirmed outcomes along with image embeddings, model predictions, and historical agent actions are stored in a memory bank as structured decision trajectories. For each new case, BUSD-Agent retrieves similar past cases based on image, model response and confidence similarity to condition the agent's current decision policy. This enables retrieval-conditioned in-context adaptation that dynamically adjusts model trust and escalation thresholds from prior experiences without parameter updates. Evaluation across 10 breast ultrasound datasets shows that the proposed experience-guided workflow reduces diagnostic escalation in BUSD-Agent from 84.95% to 58.72% and overall biopsy referrals from 59.50% to 37.08%, compared to the same architecture without trajectory conditioning, while improving average screening specificity by 68.48% and diagnostic specificity by 6.33%.

Abstract: State-of-the-art models for medical image segmentation achieve excellent accuracy but require substantial computational resources, limiting deployment in resource-constrained clinical settings. We present SegMate, an efficient 2.5D framework that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, while considerably reducing computational requirements. Our efficient design is the result of meticulously integrating asymmetric architectures, attention mechanisms, multi-scale feature fusion, slice-based positional conditioning, and multi-task optimization. We demonstrate the efficiency-accuracy trade-off of our framework across three modern backbones (EfficientNetV2-M, MambaOut-Tiny, FastViT-T12). We perform experiments on three datasets: TotalSegmentator, SegTHOR and AMOS22. Compared with the vanilla models, SegMate reduces computation (GFLOPs) by up to 2.5x and memory footprint (VRAM) by up to 2.1x, while generally registering performance gains of around 1%. On TotalSegmentator, we achieve a Dice score of 93.51% with only 295MB peak GPU memory. Zero-shot cross-dataset evaluations on SegTHOR and AMOS22 demonstrate strong generalization, with Dice scores of up to 86.85% and 89.35%, respectively. We release our open-source code at https://github.com/andreibunea99/SegMate.

Abstract: When a text description is extended with an additional detail, image-text similarity should drop if that detail is wrong. We show that CLIP-style dual encoders often violate this intuition: appending a plausible but incorrect object or relation to an otherwise correct description can increase the similarity score. We call such cases half-truths. On COCO, CLIP prefers the correct shorter description only 40.6% of the time, and performance drops to 32.9% when the added detail is a relation. We trace this vulnerability to weak supervision on caption parts: contrastive training aligns full sentences but does not explicitly enforce that individual entities and relations are grounded. We propose CS-CLIP (Component-Supervised CLIP), which decomposes captions into entity and relation units, constructs a minimally edited foil for each unit, and fine-tunes the model to score the correct unit above its foil while preserving standard dual-encoder inference. CS-CLIP raises half-truth accuracy to 69.3% and improves average performance on established compositional benchmarks by 5.7 points, suggesting that reducing half-truth errors aligns with broader gains in compositional understanding.

Abstract: Neural implicit surface reconstruction with signed distance function has made significant progress, but recovering fine details such as thin structures and complex geometries remains challenging due to unreliable or noisy geometric priors. Existing approaches rely on implicit uncertainty that arises during optimization to filter these priors, which is indirect and inefficient, and masking supervision in high-uncertainty regions further leads to under-constrained optimization. To address these issues, we propose GPU-SDF, a neural implicit framework for indoor surface reconstruction that leverages geometric prior uncertainty and complementary constraints. We introduce a self-supervised module that explicitly estimates prior uncertainty without auxiliary networks. Based on this estimation, we design an uncertainty-guided loss that modulates prior influence rather than discarding it, thereby retaining weak but informative cues. To address regions with high prior uncertainty, GPU-SDF further incorporates two complementary constraints: an edge distance field that strengthens boundary supervision and a multi-view consistency regularization that enforces geometric coherence. Extensive experiments confirm that GPU-SDF improves the reconstruction of fine details and serves as a plug-and-play enhancement for existing frameworks.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate proficiency in 2D scenes, extending their perceptual intelligence to 3D point cloud understanding remains a significant challenge. Current approaches focus primarily on aligning 3D features with pre-trained models. However, they typically treat geometric reasoning as an implicit mapping process. These methods bypass intermediate logical steps and consequently suffer from geometric hallucinations. They confidently generate plausible responses that fail to ground in precise structural details. To bridge this gap, we present PointCoT, a novel framework that empowers MLLMs with explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning for 3D data. We advocate for a \textit{Look, Think, then Answer} paradigm. In this approach, the model is supervised to generate geometry-grounded rationales before predicting final answers. To facilitate this, we construct Point-Reason-Instruct, a large-scale benchmark comprising $\sim$86k instruction-tuning samples with hierarchical CoT annotations. By leveraging a dual-stream multi-modal architecture, our method synergizes semantic appearance with geometric truth. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PointCoT achieves state-of-the-art performance on complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Knowledge-based visual question answering (KB-VQA) demonstrates significant potential for handling knowledge-intensive tasks. However, conflicts arise between static parametric knowledge in vision language models (VLMs) and dynamically retrieved information due to the static model knowledge from pre-training. The outputs either ignore retrieved contexts or exhibit inconsistent integration with parametric knowledge, posing substantial challenges for KB-VQA. Current knowledge conflict mitigation methods primarily adapted from language-based approaches, focusing on context-level conflicts through engineered prompting strategies or context-aware decoding mechanisms. However, these methods neglect the critical role of visual information in conflicts and suffer from redundant retrieved contexts, which impair accurate conflict identification and effective mitigation. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{CC-VQA}: a novel training-free, conflict- and correlation-aware method for KB-VQA. Our method comprises two core components: (1) Vision-Centric Contextual Conflict Reasoning, which performs visual-semantic conflict analysis across internal and external knowledge contexts; and (2) Correlation-Guided Encoding and Decoding, featuring positional encoding compression for low-correlation statements and adaptive decoding using correlation-weighted conflict scoring. Extensive evaluations on E-VQA, InfoSeek, and OK-VQA benchmarks demonstrate that CC-VQA achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding absolute accuracy improvements of 3.3\% to 6.4\% compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Occlusion remains a critical challenge in robotic fruit harvesting, as undetected or inaccurately localised fruits often results in substantial crop losses. To mitigate this issue, we propose a harvesting framework using a new amodal segmentation model, GDA-YOLO11, which incorporates architectural improvements and an updated asymmetric mask loss. The proposed model is trained on a modified version of a public citrus dataset and evaluated on both the base dataset and occlusion-sensitive subsets with varying occlusion levels. Within the framework, full fruit masks, including invisible regions, are inferred by GDA-YOLO11, and picking points are subsequently estimated using the Euclidean distance transform. These points are then projected into 3D coordinates for robotic harvesting execution. Experiments were conducted using real citrus fruits in a controlled environment simulating occlusion scenarios. Notably, to the best of our knowledge, this study provides the first practical demonstration of amodal instance segmentation in robotic fruit harvesting. GDA-YOLO11 achieves a precision of 0.844, recall of 0.846, mAP@50 of 0.914, and mAP@50:95 of 0.636, outperforming YOLO11n by 5.1%, 1.3%, and 1.0% in precision, mAP@50, and mAP@50:95, respectively. The framework attains harvesting success rates of 92.59%, 85.18%, 48.14%, and 22.22% at zero to high occlusion levels, improving success by 3.5% under medium and high occlusion. These findings demonstrate that GDA-YOLO11 enhances occlusion robust segmentation and streamlines perception-to-action integration, paving the way for more reliable autonomous systems in agriculture.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video diffusion models have enabled high-fidelity and temporally coherent videos synthesis. However, current models are predominantly optimized for single-event generation. When handling multi-event prompts, without explicit temporal grounding, such models often produce blended or collapsed scenes that break the intended narrative. To address this limitation, we present SwitchCraft, a training-free framework for multi-event video generation. Our key insight is that uniform prompt injection across time ignores the correspondence between events and frames. To this end, we introduce Event-Aligned Query Steering (EAQS), which steers frame-level attention to align with relevant event prompts. Furthermore, we propose Auto-Balance Strength Solver (ABSS), which adaptively balances steering strength to preserve temporal consistency and visual fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SwitchCraft substantially improves prompt alignment, event clarity, and scene consistency compared with existing baselines, offering a simple yet effective solution for multi-event video generation.

Abstract: Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) increasingly rely on visual chain-of-thought to perform region-grounded reasoning over images. However, existing approaches ground regions via either textified coordinates-causing modality mismatch and semantic fragmentation or fixed-granularity patches that both limit precise region selection and often require non-trivial architectural changes. In this paper, we propose Numerical Visual Chain-of-Thought (NV-CoT), a framework that enables MLLMs to reason over images using continuous numerical coordinates. NV-CoT expands the MLLM action space from discrete vocabulary tokens to a continuous Euclidean space, allowing models to directly generate bounding-box coordinates as actions with only minimal architectural modification. The framework supports both supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. In particular, we replace categorical token policies with a Gaussian (or Laplace) policy over coordinates and introduce stochasticity via reparameterized sampling, making NV-CoT fully compatible with GRPO-style policy optimization. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks against eight representative visual reasoning baselines demonstrate that NV-CoT significantly improves localization precision and final answer accuracy, while also accelerating training convergence, validating the effectiveness of continuous-action visual reasoning in MLLMs. The code is available in https://github.com/kesenzhao/NV-CoT.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) promise energy-efficient vision, but applying them to RGB visual tracking remains difficult: Existing SNN tracking frameworks either do not fully align with spike-driven computation or do not fully leverage neurons' spatiotemporal dynamics, leading to a trade-off between efficiency and accuracy. To address this, we introduce SpikeTrack, a spike-driven framework for energy-efficient RGB object tracking. SpikeTrack employs a novel asymmetric design that uses asymmetric timestep expansion and unidirectional information flow, harnessing spatiotemporal dynamics while cutting computation. To ensure effective unidirectional information transfer between branches, we design a memory-retrieval module inspired by neural inference mechanisms. This module recurrently queries a compact memory initialized by the template to retrieve target cues and sharpen target perception over time. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SpikeTrack achieves the state-of-the-art among SNN-based trackers and remains competitive with advanced ANN trackers. Notably, it surpasses TransT on LaSOT dataset while consuming only 1/26 of its energy. To our knowledge, SpikeTrack is the first spike-driven framework to make RGB tracking both accurate and energy efficient. The code and models are available at https://github.com/faicaiwawa/SpikeTrack.

Abstract: The widespread use of smartphones has made photography ubiquitous, yet a clear gap remains between ordinary users and professional photographers, who can identify aesthetic issues and provide actionable shooting guidance during capture. We define this capability as aesthetic guidance (AG) -- an essential but largely underexplored domain in computational aesthetics. Existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) primarily offer overly positive feedback, failing to identify issues or provide actionable guidance. Without AG capability, they cannot effectively identify distracting regions or optimize compositional balance, thus also struggling in aesthetic cropping, which aims to refine photo composition through reframing after capture. To address this, we introduce AesGuide, the first large-scale AG dataset and benchmark with 10,748 photos annotated with aesthetic scores, analyses, and guidance. Building upon it, we propose Venus, a two-stage framework that first empowers MLLMs with AG capability through progressively complex aesthetic questions and then activates their aesthetic cropping power via CoT-based rationales. Extensive experiments show that Venus substantially improves AG capability and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in aesthetic cropping, enabling interpretable and interactive aesthetic refinement across both stages of photo creation.

Abstract: Masked Image Generation Models (MIGMs) have achieved great success, yet their efficiency is hampered by the multiple steps of bi-directional attention. In fact, there exists notable redundancy in their computation: when sampling discrete tokens, the rich semantics contained in the continuous features are lost. Some existing works attempt to cache the features to approximate future features. However, they exhibit considerable approximation error under aggressive acceleration rates. We attribute this to their limited expressivity and the failure to account for sampling information. To fill this gap, we propose to learn a lightweight model that incorporates both previous features and sampled tokens, and regresses the average velocity field of feature evolution. The model has moderate complexity that suffices to capture the subtle dynamics while keeping lightweight compared to the original base model. We apply our method, MIGM-Shortcut, to two representative MIGM architectures and tasks. In particular, on the state-of-the-art Lumina-DiMOO, it achieves over 4x acceleration of text-to-image generation while maintaining quality, significantly pushing the Pareto frontier of masked image generation. The code and model weights are available at https://github.com/Kaiwen-Zhu/MIGM-Shortcut.

Abstract: It has been suggested that generative image models such as diffusion models can improve performance on clinically relevant tasks by offering deep learning models supplementary training data. However, most conditional diffusion models treat disease stages as independent classes, ignoring the continuous nature of disease progression. This mismatch is problematic in medical imaging because continuous pathological processes are typically only observed through coarse, discrete but ordered labels as in ophthalmology for diabetic retinopathy (DR). We propose an ordinal latent diffusion model for generating color fundus images that explicitly incorporates the ordered structure of DR severity into the generation process. Instead of categorical conditioning, we used a scalar disease representation, enabling a smooth transition between adjacent stages. We evaluated our approach using visual realism metrics and classification-based clinical consistency analysis on the EyePACS dataset. Compared to a standard conditional diffusion model, our model reduced the Fréchet inception distance for four of the five DR stages and increased the quadratic weighted $κ$ from 0.79 to 0.87. Furthermore, interpolation experiments showed that the model captured a continuous spectrum of disease progression learned from ordered, coarse class labels.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Vision-Language models (VLMs) has raised growing concerns that their black-box reasoning processes could lead to unintended forms of social bias. Current debiasing approaches focus on mitigating surface-level bias signals through post-hoc learning or test-time algorithms, while leaving the internal dynamics of the model largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce an interpretable, model-agnostic bias mitigation framework, DeBiasLens, that localizes social attribute neurons in VLMs through sparse autoencoders (SAEs) applied to multimodal encoders. Building upon the disentanglement ability of SAEs, we train them on facial image or caption datasets without corresponding social attribute labels to uncover neurons highly responsive to specific demographics, including those that are underrepresented. By selectively deactivating the social neurons most strongly tied to bias for each group, we effectively mitigate socially biased behaviors of VLMs without degrading their semantic knowledge. Our research lays the groundwork for future auditing tools, prioritizing social fairness in emerging real-world AI systems.

Abstract: 3D super-resolution (3DSR) aims to reconstruct high-resolution (HR) 3D scenes from low-resolution (LR) multi-view images. Existing methods rely on dense LR inputs and per-scene optimization, which restricts the high-frequency priors for constructing HR 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to those inherited from pretrained 2D super-resolution (2DSR) models. This severely limits reconstruction fidelity, cross-scene generalization, and real-time usability. We propose to reformulate 3DSR as a direct feed-forward mapping from sparse LR views to HR 3DGS representations, enabling the model to autonomously learn 3D-specific high-frequency geometry and appearance from large-scale, multi-scene data. This fundamentally changes how 3DSR acquires high-frequency knowledge and enables robust generalization to unseen scenes. Specifically, we introduce SR3R, a feed-forward framework that directly predicts HR 3DGS representations from sparse LR views via the learned mapping network. To further enhance reconstruction fidelity, we introduce Gaussian offset learning and feature refinement, which stabilize reconstruction and sharpen high-frequency details. SR3R is plug-and-play and can be paired with any feed-forward 3DGS reconstruction backbone: the backbone provides an LR 3DGS scaffold, and SR3R upscales it to an HR 3DGS. Extensive experiments across three 3D benchmarks demonstrate that SR3R surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) 3DSR methods and achieves strong zero-shot generalization, even outperforming SOTA per-scene optimization methods on unseen scenes.

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) aims to identify abnormal events in videos. Traditional VAD methods generally suffer from the high costs of labeled data and full training, thus some recent works have explored leveraging frozen multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) in a tuning-free manner to perform VAD. However, their performance is limited as they directly inherit pre-training biases and cannot adapt internal representations to specific video contexts, leading to difficulties in handling subtle or ambiguous anomalies. To address these limitations, we propose a novel intervention framework, termed SteerVAD, which advances MLLM-based VAD by shifting from passively reading to actively steering and rectifying internal representations. Our approach first leverages the gradient-free representational separability analysis (RSA) to identify top attention heads as latent anomaly experts (LAEs) which are most discriminative for VAD. Then a hierarchical meta-controller (HMC) generates dynamic rectification signals by jointly conditioning on global context and these LAE outputs. The signals execute targeted, anisotropic scaling directly upon the LAE representation manifolds, amplifying anomaly-relevant dimensions while suppressing inherent biases. Extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks demonstrate our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among tuning-free approaches requiring only 1% of training data, establishing it as a powerful new direction for video anomaly detection. The code will be released upon the publication.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in vision-language reasoning tasks, yet ensuring their safety remains a critical challenge. Recent input-side defenses detect unsafe images with CLIP and prepend safety prefixes to prompts, but they still suffer from inaccurate detection in complex scenes and unstable safety signals during decoding. To address these issues, we propose GuardAlign, a training-free defense framework that integrates two strategies. First, OT-enhanced safety detection leverages optimal transport to measure distribution distances between image patches and unsafe semantics, enabling accurate identification of malicious regions without additional computational cost. Second, cross-modal attentive calibration strengthens the influence of safety prefixes by adaptively reallocating attention across layers, ensuring that safety signals remain consistently activated throughout generation. Extensive evaluations on six representative MLLMs demonstrate that GuardAlign reduces unsafe response rates by up to 39% on SPA-VL, while preserving utility, achieving an improvement on VQAv2 from 78.51% to 79.21%.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in vision-language reasoning, yet they remain vulnerable to hallucination, where generated content deviates from visual evidence. Existing mitigation strategies either require costly supervision during training or introduce additional latency at inference time. Recent vision enhancement methods attempt to address this issue by reinforcing visual tokens during decoding, but they typically inject all tokens indiscriminately, which causes interference from background regions and distracts the model from critical cues. To overcome this challenge, we propose Adaptive Visual Reinforcement (AIR), a training-free framework for MLLMs. AIR consists of two components. Prototype-based token reduction condenses the large pool of visual tokens into a compact subset to suppress redundancy. OT-guided patch reinforcement quantifies the alignment between hidden states and patch embeddings to selectively integrate the most consistent patches into feed-forward layers. As a result, AIR enhances the model's reliance on salient visual information and effectively mitigates hallucination. Extensive experiments across representative MLLMs demonstrate that AIR substantially reduces hallucination while preserving general capabilities, establishing it as an effective solution for building reliable MLLMs.

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D clothed humans from monocular images and videos is a fundamental problem with applications in virtual try-on, avatar creation, and mixed reality. Despite significant progress in human body recovery, accurately reconstructing garment geometry, particularly for loose-fitting clothing, remains an open challenge. We propose a unified framework for high-fidelity 3D garment reconstruction from both single images and video sequences. Our approach combines Implicit Sewing Patterns (ISP) with a generative diffusion model to learn expressive garment shape priors in 2D UV space. Leveraging these priors, we introduce a mapping model that establishes correspondences between image pixels, UV pattern coordinates, and 3D geometry, enabling accurate and detailed garment reconstruction from single images. We further extend this formulation to dynamic reconstruction by introducing a spatio-temporal diffusion scheme with test-time guidance to enforce long-range temporal consistency. We also develop analytic projection-based constraints that preserve image-aligned geometry in visible regions while enforcing coherent completion in occluded areas over time. Although trained exclusively on synthetically simulated cloth data, our method generalizes well to real-world imagery and consistently outperforms existing approaches on both tight- and loose-fitting garments. The reconstructed garments preserve fine geometric detail while exhibiting realistic dynamic motion, supporting downstream applications such as texture editing, garment retargeting, and animation.

Abstract: Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) has emerged as an effective technique for alleviating the substantial computational and memory overheads of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by compressing both weights and activations without retraining the full model. Existing PTQ methods primarily rely on static identification and global compensation of sensitive or outlier channels, yet they often overlook the distributional differences of these important channels across inputs, leading to unsatisfactory quantization. In this work, we observe that the distributions and occurrence frequencies of important channels vary significantly both across modalities and among tokens, even within the same modality. Accordingly, we propose \textbf{Quant Experts (QE)}, a token-aware adaptive error compensation with mixture-of-experts for VLMs quantization. QE divides the important channels into token-independent and token-dependent groups. For the former, a shared expert is designed for most tokens to compensate for global quantization error using a low-rank adapter. For the latter, routed experts including multiple routed low-rank adapters are elaborated to compensate for local quantization error related to specific tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that QE consistently enhances task accuracy across various quantization settings and model scales, ranging from 2B to 70B parameters, while maintaining performance comparable to full-precision models.

Abstract: Recent advancements in neural surface reconstruction have significantly enhanced 3D reconstruction. However, current real world datasets mainly focus on benchmarking multiview stereo (MVS) based on RGB inputs. Multiview photometric stereo (MVPS) and multiview shape from polarization (MVSfP), though indispensable on high-fidelity surface reconstruction and sparse inputs, have not been quantitatively assessed together with MVS. To determine the working range of different MVX (MVS, MVSfP, and MVPS) techniques, we propose EvalMVX, a real-world dataset containing $25$ objects, each captured with a polarized camera under $20$ varying views and $17$ light conditions including OLAT and natural illumination, leading to $8,500$ images. Each object includes aligned ground-truth 3D mesh, facilitating quantitative benchmarking of MVX methods simultaneously. Based on our EvalMVX, we evaluate $13$ MVX methods published in recent years, record the best-performing methods, and identify open problems under diverse geometric details and reflectance types. We hope EvalMVX and the benchmarking results can inspire future research on multiview 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: Learning directly from boundary representations (B-reps) has significantly advanced 3D CAD analysis. However, state-of-the-art B-rep learning methods rely on absolute coordinates and normals to encode global context, making them highly sensitive to rotations. Our experiments reveal that models achieving over 95% accuracy on aligned benchmarks can collapse to as low as 10% under arbitrary $\mathbf{SO}(3)$ rotations. To address this, we introduce FoV-Net, the first B-rep learning framework that captures both local surface geometry and global structural context in a rotation-invariant manner. Each face is represented by a Local Reference Frame (LRF) UV-grid that encodes its local surface geometry, and by Field-of-View (FoV) grids that capture the surrounding 3D context by casting rays and recording intersections with neighboring faces. Lightweight CNNs extract per-face features, which are propagated over the B-rep graph using a graph attention network. FoV-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance on B-rep classification and segmentation benchmarks, demonstrating robustness to arbitrary rotations while also requiring less training data to achieve strong results.

Abstract: Simulation is essential to the development and evaluation of autonomous robots such as self-driving vehicles. Neural reconstruction is emerging as a promising solution as it enables simulating a wide variety of scenarios from real-world data alone in an automated and scalable way. However, while methods such as NeRF and 3D Gaussian Splatting can produce visually compelling results, they often exhibit artifacts particularly when rendering novel views, and fail to realistically integrate inserted dynamic objects, especially when they were captured from different scenes. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DiffusionHarmonizer, an online generative enhancement framework that transforms renderings from such imperfect scenes into temporally consistent outputs while improving their realism. At its core is a single-step temporally-conditioned enhancer that is converted from a pretrained multi-step image diffusion model, capable of running in online simulators on a single GPU. The key to training it effectively is a custom data curation pipeline that constructs synthetic-real pairs emphasizing appearance harmonization, artifact correction, and lighting realism. The result is a scalable system that significantly elevates simulation fidelity in both research and production environments.

Abstract: In 3D point cloud object tracking, the motion-centric methods have emerged as a promising avenue due to its superior performance in modeling inter-frame motion. However, existing two-stage motion-based approaches suffer from fundamental limitations: (1) error accumulation due to decoupled optimization caused by explicit foreground segmentation prior to motion estimation, and (2) computational bottlenecks from sequential processing. To address these challenges, we propose FocusTrack, a novel one-stage paradigms tracking framework that unifies motion-semantics co-modeling through two core innovations: Inter-frame Motion Modeling (IMM) and Focus-and-Suppress Attention. The IMM module employs a temp-oral-difference siamese encoder to capture global motion patterns between adjacent frames. The Focus-and-Suppress attention that enhance the foreground semantics via motion-salient feature gating and suppress the background noise based on the temporal-aware motion context from IMM without explicit segmentation. Based on above two designs, FocusTrack enables end-to-end training with compact one-stage pipeline. Extensive experiments on prominent 3D tracking benchmarks, such as KITTI, nuScenes, and Waymo, demonstrate that the FocusTrack achieves new SOTA performance while running at a high speed with 105 FPS.

Abstract: The expansion of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) into multimodal domains has intensified the challenge for processing complex visual documents, such as financial reports. While page-level chunking and retrieval is a natural starting point, it creates a critical bottleneck: delivering entire pages to the generator introduces excessive extraneous context. This not only overloads the generator's attention mechanism but also dilutes the most salient evidence. Moreover, compressing these information-rich pages into a limited visual token budget further increases the risk of hallucinations. To address this, we introduce AgenticOCR, a dynamic parsing paradigm that transforms optical character recognition (OCR) from a static, full-text process into a query-driven, on-demand extraction system. By autonomously analyzing document layout in a "thinking with images" manner, AgenticOCR identifies and selectively recognizes regions of interest. This approach performs on-demand decompression of visual tokens precisely where needed, effectively decoupling retrieval granularity from rigid page-level chunking. AgenticOCR has the potential to serve as the "third building block" of the visual document RAG stack, operating alongside and enhancing standard Embedding and Reranking modules. Experimental results demonstrate that AgenticOCR improves both the efficiency and accuracy of visual RAG systems, achieving expert-level performance in long document understanding. Code and models are available at https://github.com/OpenDataLab/AgenticOCR.

Abstract: Recent significant advances in 3D scene representation have been driven by 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), which has enabled real-time rendering with photorealistic quality. 3DGS often requires a large number of primitives to achieve high fidelity, leading to redundant representations and high resource consumption, thereby limiting its scalability for complex or large-scale scenes. Consequently, effective pruning strategies and more expressive primitives that can reduce redundancy while preserving visual quality are crucial for practical deployment. We propose an efficient, integrated reconstruction-aware pruning strategy that adaptively determines pruning timing and refining intervals based on reconstruction quality, thus reducing model size while enhancing rendering quality. Moreover, we introduce a 3D Difference-of-Gaussians primitive that jointly models both positive and negative densities in a single primitive, improving the expressiveness of Gaussians under compact configurations. Our method significantly improves model compactness, achieving up to 90\% reduction in Gaussian-count while delivering visual quality that is similar to, or in some cases better than, that produced by state-of-the-art methods. Code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Recognizing surgical phases and steps from video is a fundamental problem in computer-assisted interventions. Recent approaches increasingly rely on large-scale pre-training on thousands of labeled surgical videos, followed by zero-shot transfer to specific procedures. While effective, this strategy incurs substantial computational and data collection costs. In this work, we question whether such heavy pre-training is truly necessary. We propose Text-Augmented Action Segmentation Optimal Transport (TASOT), an unsupervised method for surgical phase and step recognition that extends Action Segmentation Optimal Transport (ASOT) by incorporating textual information generated directly from the videos. TASOT formulates temporal action segmentation as a multimodal optimal transport problem, where the matching cost is defined as a weighted combination of visual and text-based costs. The visual term captures frame-level appearance similarity, while the text term provides complementary semantic cues, and both are jointly regularized through a temporally consistent unbalanced Gromov-Wasserstein formulation. This design enables effective alignment between video frames and surgical actions without surgical-specific pretraining or external web-scale supervision. We evaluate TASOT on multiple benchmark surgical datasets and observe consistent and substantial improvements over existing zero-shot methods, including StrasBypass70 (+23.7), BernBypass70 (+4.5), Cholec80 (+16.5), and AutoLaparo (+19.6). These results demonstrate that fine-grained surgical understanding can be achieved by exploiting information already present in standard visual and textual representations, without resorting to increasingly complex pre-training pipelines. The code will be available at https://github.com/omar8ahmed9/TASOT.

Abstract: Decoupled dataset distillation (DD) compresses large corpora into a few synthetic images by matching a frozen teacher's statistics. However, current residual-matching pipelines rely on static real patches, creating a fit-complexity gap and a pull-to-anchor effect that reduce intra-class diversity and hurt generalization. To address these issues, we introduce RETA -- a Retrieval and Topology Alignment framework for decoupled DD. First, Dynamic Retrieval Connection (DRC) selects a real patch from a prebuilt pool by minimizing a fit-complexity score in teacher feature space; the chosen patch is injected via a residual connection to tighten feature fit while controlling injected complexity. Second, Persistent Topology Alignment (PTA) regularizes synthesis with persistent homology: we build a mutual k-NN feature graph, compute persistence images of components and loops, and penalize topology discrepancies between real and synthetic sets, mitigating pull-to-anchor effect. Across CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet, ImageNet-1K, and multiple ImageNet subsets, RETA consistently outperforms various baselines under comparable time and memory, especially reaching 64.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with ResNet-18 at 50 images per class, +3.1% over the best prior.

Abstract: We present a method for generating a full 360° orbit video around a person from a single input image. Existing methods typically adapt image-based diffusion models for multi-view synthesis, but yield inconsistent results across views and with the original identity. In contrast, recent video diffusion models have demonstrated their ability in generating photorealistic results that align well with the given prompts. Inspired by these results, we propose HumanOrbit, a video diffusion model for multi-view human image generation. Our approach enables the model to synthesize continuous camera rotations around the subject, producing geometrically consistent novel views while preserving the appearance and identity of the person. Using the generated multi-view frames, we further propose a reconstruction pipeline that recovers a textured mesh of the subject. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of HumanOrbit for multi-view image generation and that the reconstructed 3D models exhibit superior completeness and fidelity compared to those from state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Vision transformers have recently made a breakthrough in computer vision showing excellent performance in terms of precision for numerous applications. However, their computational cost is very high compared to alternative approaches such as Convolutional Neural Networks. To address this problem, we propose a novel framework for image classification called RAViT based on a multi-branch network that operates on several copies of the same image with different resolutions to reduce the computational cost while preserving the overall accuracy. Furthermore, our framework includes an early exit mechanism that makes our model adaptive and allows to choose the appropriate trade-off between accuracy and computational cost at run-time. For example in a two-branch architecture, the original image is first resized to reduce its resolution, then a prediction is performed on it using a first transformer and the resulting prediction is reused together with the original-size image to perform a final prediction on a second transformer with less computation than a classical Vision transformer architecture. The early-exit process allows the model to make a final prediction at intermediate branches, saving even more computation. We evaluated our approach on CIFAR-10, Tiny ImageNet, and ImageNet. We obtained an equivalent accuracy to the classical Vision transformer model with only around 70% of FLOPs.

Abstract: High-dimensional images, or images with a high-dimensional attribute vector per pixel, are commonly explored with coordinated views of a low-dimensional embedding of the attribute space and a conventional image representation. Nowadays, such images can easily contain several million pixels. For such large datasets, hierarchical embedding techniques are better suited to represent the high-dimensional attribute space than flat dimensionality reduction methods. However, available hierarchical dimensionality reduction methods construct the hierarchy purely based on the attribute information and ignore the spatial layout of pixels in the images. This impedes the exploration of regions of interest in the image space, since there is no congruence between a region of interest in image space and the associated attribute abstractions in the hierarchy. In this paper, we present a superpixel hierarchy for high-dimensional images that takes the high-dimensional attribute manifold into account during construction. Through this, our method enables consistent exploration of high-dimensional images in both image and attribute space. We show the effectiveness of this new image-guided hierarchy in the context of embedding exploration by comparing it with classical hierarchical embedding-based image exploration in two use cases.

Abstract: Reconstructing photorealistic and animatable 4D head avatars from a single portrait image remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. While diffusion models have enabled remarkable progress in image and video generation for avatar reconstruction, existing methods primarily rely on 2D priors and struggle to achieve consistent 3D geometry. We propose a novel framework that leverages geometry-aware diffusion to learn strong geometry priors for high-fidelity head avatar reconstruction. Our approach jointly synthesizes portrait images and corresponding surface normals, while a pose-free expression encoder captures implicit expression representations. Both synthesized images and expression latents are incorporated into 3D Gaussian-based avatars, enabling photorealistic rendering with accurate geometry. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in visual quality, expression fidelity, and cross-identity generalization, while supporting real-time rendering.

Abstract: Pre-trained vision encoders like DINOv2 have demonstrated exceptional performance on unimodal tasks. However, we observe that their feature representations are poorly aligned across different modalities. For instance, the feature embedding for an RGB image and its corresponding depth map of the same scene exhibit a cosine similarity that is nearly identical to that of two random, unrelated images. To address this, we propose the Omnivorous Vision Encoder, a novel framework that learns a modality-agnostic feature space. We train the encoder with a dual objective: first, to maximize the feature alignment between different modalities of the same scene; and second, a distillation objective that anchors the learned representations to the output of a fully frozen teacher such as DINOv2. The resulting student encoder becomes "omnivorous" by producing a consistent, powerful embedding for a given scene, regardless of the input modality (RGB, Depth, Segmentation, etc.). This approach enables robust cross-modal understanding while retaining the discriminative semantics of the original foundation model.

Abstract: Despite advances in machine learning-based medical image classifiers, the safety and reliability of these systems remain major concerns in practical settings. Existing auditing approaches mainly rely on unimodal features or metadata-based subgroup analyses, which are limited in interpretability and often fail to capture hidden systematic failures. To address these limitations, we introduce the first automated auditing framework that extends slice discovery methods to multimodal representations specifically for medical applications. Comprehensive experiments were conducted under common failure scenarios using the MIMIC-CXR-JPG dataset, demonstrating the framework's strong capability in both failure discovery and explanation generation. Our results also show that multimodal information generally allows more comprehensive and effective auditing of classifiers, while unimodal variants beyond image-only inputs exhibit strong potential in scenarios where resources are constrained.

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve state-of-the-art video generation quality, but their inference remains expensive due to the large number of sequential denoising steps. This has motivated a growing line of research on accelerating diffusion inference. Among training-free acceleration methods, caching reduces computation by reusing previously computed model outputs across timesteps. Existing caching methods rely on heuristic criteria to choose cache/reuse timesteps and require extensive tuning. We address this limitation with a principled sensitivity-aware caching framework. Specifically, we formalize the caching error through an analysis of the model output sensitivity to perturbations in the denoising inputs, i.e., the noisy latent and the timestep, and show that this sensitivity is a key predictor of caching error. Based on this analysis, we propose Sensitivity-Aware Caching (SenCache), a dynamic caching policy that adaptively selects caching timesteps on a per-sample basis. Our framework provides a theoretical basis for adaptive caching, explains why prior empirical heuristics can be partially effective, and extends them to a dynamic, sample-specific approach. Experiments on Wan 2.1, CogVideoX, and LTX-Video show that SenCache achieves better visual quality than existing caching methods under similar computational budgets.

Abstract: Modern microscopy routinely produces gigapixel images that contain structures across multiple spatial scales, from fine cellular morphology to broader tissue organization. Many analysis tasks require combining these scales, yet most vision models operate at a single resolution or derive multi-scale features from one view, limiting their ability to exploit the inherently multi-resolution nature of microscopy data. We introduce MuViT, a transformer architecture built to fuse true multi-resolution observations from the same underlying image. MuViT embeds all patches into a shared world-coordinate system and extends rotary positional embeddings to these coordinates, enabling attention to integrate wide-field context with high-resolution detail within a single encoder. Across synthetic benchmarks, kidney histopathology, and high-resolution mouse-brain microscopy, MuViT delivers consistent improvements over strong ViT and CNN baselines. Multi-resolution MAE pretraining further produces scale-consistent representations that enhance downstream tasks. These results demonstrate that explicit world-coordinate modelling provides a simple yet powerful mechanism for leveraging multi-resolution information in large-scale microscopy analysis.

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-image generation has greatly advanced visual fidelity and creativity, but it has also imposed higher demands on prompt complexity-particularly in encoding intricate spatial relationships. In such cases, achieving satisfactory results often requires multiple sampling attempts. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel method that strengthens the spatial understanding of current image generation models. We first construct the SpatialReward-Dataset with over 80k preference pairs. Building on this dataset, we build SpatialScore, a reward model designed to evaluate the accuracy of spatial relationships in text-to-image generation, achieving performance that even surpasses leading proprietary models on spatial evaluation. We further demonstrate that this reward model effectively enables online reinforcement learning for the complex spatial generation. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that our specialized reward model yields significant and consistent gains in spatial understanding for image generation.

Abstract: Diffusion-based Real-World Image Super-Resolution (Real-ISR) achieves impressive perceptual quality but suffers from high computational costs due to iterative sampling. While recent distillation approaches leveraging large-scale Text-to-Image (T2I) priors have enabled one-step generation, they are typically hindered by prohibitive parameter counts and the inherent capability bounds imposed by teacher models. As a lightweight alternative, Consistency Models offer efficient inference but struggle with two critical limitations: the accumulation of consistency drift inherent to transitive training, and a phenomenon we term "Geometric Decoupling" - where the generative trajectory achieves pixel-wise alignment yet fails to preserve structural coherence. To address these challenges, we propose GTASR (Geometric Trajectory Alignment Super-Resolution), a simple yet effective consistency training paradigm for Real-ISR. Specifically, we introduce a Trajectory Alignment (TA) strategy to rectify the tangent vector field via full-path projection, and a Dual-Reference Structural Rectification (DRSR) mechanism to enforce strict structural constraints. Extensive experiments verify that GTASR delivers superior performance over representative baselines while maintaining minimal latency. The code and model will be released at https://github.com/Blazedengcy/GTASR.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Compositional generalization, the ability to recognize familiar parts in novel contexts, is a defining property of intelligent systems. Although modern models are trained on massive datasets, they still cover only a tiny fraction of the combinatorial space of possible inputs, raising the question of what structure representations must have to support generalization to unseen combinations. We formalize three desiderata for compositional generalization under standard training (divisibility, transferability, stability) and show they impose necessary geometric constraints: representations must decompose linearly into per-concept components, and these components must be orthogonal across concepts. This provides theoretical grounding for the Linear Representation Hypothesis: the linear structure widely observed in neural representations is a necessary consequence of compositional generalization. We further derive dimension bounds linking the number of composable concepts to the embedding geometry. Empirically, we evaluate these predictions across modern vision models (CLIP, SigLIP, DINO) and find that representations exhibit partial linear factorization with low-rank, near-orthogonal per-concept factors, and that the degree of this structure correlates with compositional generalization on unseen combinations. As models continue to scale, these conditions predict the representational geometry they may converge to. Code is available at https://github.com/oshapio/necessary-compositionality.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Humans perceive actions through key transitions that structure actions across multiple abstraction levels, whereas machines, relying on visual features, tend to over-segment. This highlights the difficulty of enabling hierarchical reasoning in video understanding. Interestingly, we observe that lower-level visual and high-level action latent variables evolve at different rates, with low-level visual variables changing rapidly, while high-level action variables evolve more slowly, making them easier to identify. Building on this insight, we propose the Hierarchical Action Learning (\textbf{HAL}) model for weakly-supervised action segmentation. Our approach introduces a hierarchical causal data generation process, where high-level latent action governs the dynamics of low-level visual features. To model these varying timescales effectively, we introduce deterministic processes to align these latent variables over time. The \textbf{HAL} model employs a hierarchical pyramid transformer to capture both visual features and latent variables, and a sparse transition constraint is applied to enforce the slower dynamics of high-level action variables. This mechanism enhances the identification of these latent variables over time. Under mild assumptions, we prove that these latent action variables are strictly identifiable. Experimental results on several benchmarks show that the \textbf{HAL} model significantly outperforms existing methods for weakly-supervised action segmentation, confirming its practical effectiveness in real-world applications.

Abstract: Scaling video generation from seconds to minutes faces a critical bottleneck: while short-video data is abundant and high-fidelity, coherent long-form data is scarce and limited to narrow domains. To address this, we propose a training paradigm where Mode Seeking meets Mean Seeking, decoupling local fidelity from long-term coherence based on a unified representation via a Decoupled Diffusion Transformer. Our approach utilizes a global Flow Matching head trained via supervised learning on long videos to capture narrative structure, while simultaneously employing a local Distribution Matching head that aligns sliding windows to a frozen short-video teacher via a mode-seeking reverse-KL divergence. This strategy enables the synthesis of minute-scale videos that learns long-range coherence and motions from limited long videos via supervised flow matching, while inheriting local realism by aligning every sliding-window segment of the student to a frozen short-video teacher, resulting in a few-step fast long video generator. Evaluations show that our method effectively closes the fidelity-horizon gap by jointly improving local sharpness, motion and long-range consistency.

Abstract: Dense 4D reconstruction from unposed images remains a critical challenge, with current methods relying on slow test-time optimization or fragmented, task-specific feedforward models. We introduce UFO-4D, a unified feedforward framework to reconstruct a dense, explicit 4D representation from just a pair of unposed images. UFO-4D directly estimates dynamic 3D Gaussian Splats, enabling the joint and consistent estimation of 3D geometry, 3D motion, and camera pose in a feedforward manner. Our core insight is that differentiably rendering multiple signals from a single Dynamic 3D Gaussian representation offers major training advantages. This approach enables a self-supervised image synthesis loss while tightly coupling appearance, depth, and motion. Since all modalities share the same geometric primitives, supervising one inherently regularizes and improves the others. This synergy overcomes data scarcity, allowing UFO-4D to outperform prior work by up to 3 times in joint geometry, motion, and camera pose estimation. Our representation also enables high-fidelity 4D interpolation across novel views and time. Please visit our project page for visual results: https://ufo-4d.github.io/

Abstract: Curation is a significant barrier to using 'big data' radiotherapy planning databases of 100,000+ patients. Anatomic site stratification is essential for downstream analyses, but current methods rely on inconsistent plan labels or target nomenclature, which is unreliable for multi-institutional data. We developed software to automate labeling by inferring anatomic regions directly from dose-volume overlap with deep-learning segmentations, eliminating metadata reliance. The software processes DICOM files in bulk, utilizing deep learning to segment 118 structures (organs, glands, and bones) categorized into six regions: Cranial, Head and Neck, Pelvis, Abdomen, Thorax, Extremity. The 85% and 50% isodose lines are converted to structures to compute organ-specific dose-overlap metrics. Plans are assigned ranked regional labels based on these intersections. The algorithm was refined using 109 expert-labeled cases and validated on 100 consecutive clinical plans. On the 100-plan test dataset, the algorithm achieved 91% Exact Accuracy (matching all expert labels and order), 94% Top-2 Accuracy (matching the top two expert regions regardless of order), and 95% Top-1 Accuracy (matching the primary expert label). The automated workflow demonstrated high accuracy and robustness. The 95% Top-1 Accuracy is particularly significant, as it enables reliable querying of plans based on the primary treatment site. Detailed analysis of the few mismatched cases showed most were treated areas at the border between anatomic regions and were ambiguous between these two regions in a common-sense interpretation. This algorithm provides a scalable, standardized solution for curating the large, multi-institutional datasets required for 'big data' in radiotherapy and provides an important complement to text-based approaches.

Abstract: Creating new documents by synthesizing information from existing sources is an important part of knowledge work in many domains. This process often involves gathering content from multiple documents, organizing it, and then transforming it into new forms such as reports, slides, or spreadsheets. While recent advances in Generative AI have shown potential in automating parts of this process, they often provide limited user control over the handling of multimodal inputs and outputs. In this work, we introduce the notion of "infomorphs" which are modular, user-steerable, AI-augmented transformations that support controlled synthesis, and restructuring of information across formats and modalities. We propose a design space that leverage infomorph-driven workflows to enable flexible, interactive, and multimodal document creation by combining Generative AI techniques with user intent and desired information context. As a concrete instantiation of this design space, we present DocuCraft, a canvas-based interface to visually compose infomorph workflows. DocuCraft allows users to chain together infomorphs that perform operations such as page extraction, content summarization, reformatting, and generation, leveraging Generative AI at each stage to support rich, cross-document and cross-modal transformations. We demonstrate the capabilities of DocuCraft through an example-driven usage scenario that spans across different facets of common knowledge work tasks illustrating its support for fluid, human-in-the-loop document synthesis and highlights opportunities for more transparent and modular interaction for Generative AI-assisted information work.

Abstract: Interactive AI systems, such as recommendation engines and virtual assistants, commonly use static user profiles and predefined rules to personalize interactions. However, these methods often fail to capture the dynamic nature of user preferences and context. This study proposes a theoretical framework and practical implementation for integrating continuous feedback loops into personalization algorithms to enable real-time adaptation. By continuously collecting and analyzing user feedback, the AI system can dynamically adjust its recommendations, responses, and interactions to better align with the user's current context and preferences. We provide theoretical guarantees for the convergence and regret bounds of our adaptive personalization algorithm. Our experimental evaluation across three domains-recommendation systems, virtual assistants, and adaptive learning platforms-demonstrates that dynamic personalization improves user satisfaction by 15-23% compared to static methods while maintaining computational efficiency. We investigated the implementation challenges of continuous feedback mechanisms, evaluated their impact on user experience and satisfaction, and provided a comprehensive analysis of the trade-offs between personalization quality, computational overhead, and user fatigue.

Abstract: Current research on visual analytics systems largely follows the research paradigm of interactive system design in the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and includes key methodologies including design requirement development based on user needs, interactive system design, and system evaluation. However, most studies under this paradigm have a contradiction: there is a significant mismatch between the research methods developed for simple cognitive behaviors (e.g., color perception, the perception of spatial relationship among interactive artifacts) and research goals targeting for complex analytical behaviors (e.g., reasoning, problem-solving, decision-making). This mismatch may hurt the theoretical contributions of research studies, in particularly the internal validity of a designed system and the external validity of design methods. To address this challenge, this paper argues for a need to go beyond traditional HCI theoretical foundations and proposes to adopt complex cognition theories to build new theoretical foundations. Specifically, this paper analyzes how current design and evaluation methods in research on visual analytics systems constrain the internal and external validity of research, discusses the connections between complex cognition theories and visual analytics tasks, and explores how problem-solving theories from complex cognition can guide research on visual analytics systems.

Abstract: Innovative HealthTech teams develop Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems in contexts where ethical expectations and organizational priorities must be balanced under severe resource constraints. While Responsible AI practices are expected to guide the design and evaluation of such systems, they frequently remain abstract or poorly aligned with the operational realities of early-stage innovation. At the ecosystem level, this misalignment disproportionately affects disadvantaged projects and founders, therefore limiting the diversity of problem-areas under consideration, solutions, stakeholder perspectives, and population datasets represented in AI-enabled healthcare systems.
  Visualization provides a practical mechanism for supporting decision-making across the AI lifecycle. When developed via a rigorous and collaborative design process, structured on domain knowledge and designed around real-world constraints, visual interfaces can operate as effective sociotechnical governance artifacts enabling responsible decision-making.
  Grounded in innovation-oriented Human-Centered Computing methodologies, we synthesize insights from a series of design studies conducted via a longitudinal visualization research program, a case study centered on governance dashboard design in a translational setting, and a survey of a cohort of early-stage HealthTech startups. Based on these findings, we articulate design process implications for governance-oriented visualization systems: co-creation with stakeholders, alignment with organizational maturity and context, and support for heterogeneous roles and tasks among others. This work contributes actionable guidance for designing Responsible AI governance dashboards that support decision-making and accountability in early-stage health innovation, and suggests that ecosystem-level coordination can enable more scalable and diverse AI innovation in healthcare.

Abstract: Millions of people live with cognitive impairment from Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). Voice-enabled smart home systems offer promise for supporting daily living but rely on automatic speech recognition (ASR) to transcribe their speech to text. Prior work has shown reduced ASR performance for adults with cognitive impairment; however, the acoustic factors underlying these disparities remain poorly understood. This paper evaluates ASR performance for 83 older adults across cognitive groups (cognitively normal, mild cognitive impairment, dementia) reading commands to a voice assistant (Amazon Alexa). Results show that ASR errors are significantly higher for individuals with dementia, revealing a critical usability gap. To better understand these disparities, we conducted an acoustic analysis of speech features and found that a speaker's intensity, voice quality, and pause ratio predicted ASR accuracy. Based on these findings, we outline HCI design implications for AgeTech and voice interfaces, including speaker-personalized ASR, human-in-the-loop correction of ASR transcripts, and interaction-level personalization to support ability-based adaptation.

Abstract: The proliferation of robots in public spaces necessitates a deeper understanding of how these robots can interact with those they share the space with. In this paper, we present findings from video analysis of publicly deployed cleaning robots in a transit space, a major commercial airport, using their navigational 'troubles' as a tool to document what robots currently lack in interactional competence. We demonstrate that these robots, while technically proficient, can disrupt the social order of a space due to their inability to understand core aspects of human movement: mutual adjustment to others, the significance of understanding social groups, and the purpose of different locations. In discussion we argue for exploring a new design space of movement: socially-aware movement. By developing "strong concepts" that treat movement as an interactional and collaborative accomplishment, we can create systems that better integrate into the everyday rhythms of public life.

Abstract: Recent work identified clarity as one of the top quality attributes that notebook users value, but notebooks lack support for maintaining clarity throughout the exploratory phases of the notebook authoring workflow. We propose always-clear notebook authoring that supports both clarity and exploration, and present a Jupyter implementation called Tidynote. The key to Tidynote is three-fold: (1) a scratchpad sidebar to facilitate exploration, (2) cells movable between the notebook and the scratchpad to maintain organization, and (3) linear execution with state forks to clarify program state. An exploratory study (N=13) of open-ended data analysis tasks shows that Tidynote features holistically promote clarity throughout a notebook's lifecycle, support realistic notebook tasks, and enable novel strategies for notebook clarity. These results suggest that Tidynote supports maintaining clarity throughout the entirety of notebook authoring.

Abstract: Extended Reality (XR) technologies are increasingly tested outside the lab, in homes, schools, and public spaces. While this shift enables more realistic user insights, it also introduces safety challenges that are often overlooked. Physical risks, psychological distress, and accessibility issues can be increased in field studies and unsupervised testing, such as at home or crowdsourced trials. Without clear instructions, safety decisions are left to individual researchers, raising questions of responsibility and consistency. This position paper outlines key safety risks in XR user testing beyond the lab and calls for practical strategies that are needed to help researchers run XR studies in a safe and inclusive way across different environments.

Abstract: Virtual environments (VEs) are increasingly used for immersive experiences, training simulations, and entertainment, yet factors such as height perception and user stance can significantly influence user experience (UX). Height perception in VEs plays a crucial role in shaping UX, particularly in immersive applications such as climbing simulations. This study investigates the effects of height in various VEs and examines how user stance, sitting or standing, impacts immersion, perceived height, and motion sickness.
  A user study was conducted with 25 participants who played through five randomized climbing scenarios, ranging from indoor climbing gyms to outdoor cityscapes and mountainous terrains. Participants' UX was assessed using standardized questionnaires, including the IPQ for general presence, spatial presence, involvement, and experienced realism, as well as the SSQ to evaluate motion sickness symptoms such as nausea, oculomotor strain, and disorientation.
  Results indicate that seated participants experienced slightly higher immersion but were also more susceptible to motion sickness compared to those standing. While standing participants maintained consistent scores across different environments, seated participants reported increased immersion and discomfort as the VEs became larger, more physically demanding, and visually complex.

Abstract: Cooperative play (co-play) is often positioned as a family-beneficial practice that can strengthen parent-child bonds and support parental mediation in games. Yet co-play in user-generated virtual worlds (UGVWs) can be disrupted by real-time harms that parents cannot easily prevent. Roblox, a platform with millions of user-generated virtual worlds and a large child player base, illustrates this challenge. Prior work on harmful UGVW design highlights risks beyond content problems, including manipulative monetization prompts, unmoderated social interactions, emergent in-world behaviors, and narrative designs that may normalize harmful ideologies. Current governance and moderation approaches, largely adapted from social media, focus on static artifacts and often fail to capture interactive and emergent harms in virtual worlds. This workshop paper asks: how might UGVWs and their platforms be designed to minimize harms that specifically impair family co-play experiences?

Abstract: Teaching assistants (TAs) are essential to grading and feedback provision in proof-based courses, yet these tasks are time-intensive and difficult to scale. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have been studied for grading and feedback, their effectiveness in proof-based courses is still unknown. Before designing LLM-based systems for this context, a necessary prerequisite is to understand whether LLMs can meaningfully assist TAs with grading and feedback. As such, we present a multi-part case study functioning as a technology probe in an undergraduate proof-based course. We compare rubric-based grading decisions made by an LLM and TAs with varying levels of expertise and examine TAs' perceptions of feedback generated by an LLM. We find substantial disagreement between LLMs and TAs on grading decisions but that LLM-generated feedback can still be useful to TAs for submissions with major errors. We conclude by discussing design implications for human-AI grading and feedback systems in proof-based courses.

Abstract: This paper argues that the two leading AGI firms -- OpenAI and Anthropic -- construct sociotechnical imaginaries through a structurally consistent rhetorical strategy, despite meaningful differences in execution. Drawing on Jasanoff (2015)'s framework of sociotechnical imaginaries, the paper analyzes two essays published in late 2024: Sam Altman's "The Intelligence Age" and Dario Amodei's "Machines of Loving Grace." Close comparative reading identifies four shared rhetorical operations: the self-exemption move, which disavows prophetic authority while exercising it; teleological naturalization, which embeds AGI's arrival in narratives of historical inevitability; qualified acknowledgment, which absorbs concessions to risk into an optimistic frame; and implicit indispensability, which positions each firm as central to the imagined future without naming it as a commercial actor. That two competing institutions with different cultures, risk philosophies, and leaders with notably different public personae converge on the same rhetorical architecture suggests the imaginary reflects not only firm-level strategy but the institutional position these firms occupy. The paper extends the sociotechnical imaginaries framework from nation-states to private firms at the frontier of transformative technology development, identifies the discursive mechanism through which corporate authority over technological futures is projected and stabilized, and demonstrates that this mechanism is at minimum structural rather than idiosyncratic. The findings raise the question of what institutional arrangements would make that authority contestable from outside the firms that produce it.

Abstract: High text recognition performance does not guarantee that Vision-Language Models (VLMs) share human-like decision patterns when resolving ambiguity. We investigate this behavioral gap by directly comparing humans and VLMs using continuously interpolated Japanese character shapes generated via a $β$-VAE. We estimate decision boundaries in a single-character recognition (shape-only task) and evaluate whether VLM responses align with human judgments under shape in context (i.e., embedding an ambiguous character near the human decision boundary in word-level context). We find that human and VLM decision boundaries differ in the shape-only task, and that shape in context can improve human alignment in some conditions. These results highlight qualitative behavioral differences, offering foundational insights toward human--VLM alignment benchmarking.

Abstract: Hand-tracking enables controller-free XR interaction but does not have the tactile feedback controllers provide. Rather than treating this solely as a missing-sensation problem, we explore whether pseudo-haptic cues on an embodied virtual hand act as tactile or as affect substitutes that shape how interactions feel. We used a mixed reality prototype that keeps the contacted surface visually neutral, rendering cues on the hand with motion modulation for texture, color glow, and movement-coupled sound. In a within-subjects study (n=12), participants experienced 12 conditions (4 effects x 3 modalities: audio, visual, both) and reported subjective affect and cognitive demand. Participants rarely reported sustained tactile, thermal sensations, yet affect shifted systematically: rough-hot lowered valence increasing arousal, while smooth-cold produced calmer pleasant states. These findings suggest that pseudo-haptics in XR may be better understood as an affective feedback channel rather than a direct replacement for physical touch in controller-free systems.

Abstract: The automated detection of sexism in memes is a challenging task due to multimodal ambiguity, cultural nuance, and the use of humor to provide plausible deniability. Content-only models often fail to capture the complexity of human perception. To address this limitation, we introduce and validate a human-centered paradigm that augments standard content features with physiological data. We created a novel resource by recording Eye-Tracking (ET), Heart Rate (HR), and Electroencephalography (EEG) from 16 subjects (8 per experiment) while they viewed 3984 memes from the EXIST 2025 dataset. Our statistical analysis reveals significant physiological differences in how subjects process sexist versus non-sexist content. Sexist memes were associated with higher cognitive load, reflected in increased fixation counts and longer reaction times, as well as differences in EEG spectral power across the Alpha, Beta, and Gamma bands, suggesting more demanding neural processing.
  Building on these findings, we propose a multimodal fusion model that integrates physiological signals with enriched textual-visual features derived from a Vision-Language Model (VLM). Our final model achieves an AUC of 0.794 in binary sexism detection, a statistically significant 3.4% improvement over a strong VLM-based baseline. The fusion is particularly effective for nuanced cases, boosting the F1-score for the most challenging fine-grained category, Misogyny and Non-Sexual Violence, by 26.3%. These results show that physiological responses provide an objective signal of perception that enhances the accuracy and human-awareness of automated systems for countering online sexism.

Abstract: Understanding how individuals navigate mental health challenges over time is critical yet methodologically challenging. Traditional approaches analyze community-level snapshots, failing to capture dynamic individual recovery trajectories. We introduce a novel framework applying Topological Data Analysis (TDA) specifically persistent homology to model users' longitudinal posting histories as trajectories in semantic embedding space. Our approach reveals topological signatures of trajectory patterns: loops indicate cycling back to similar states (stagnation), while flares suggest exploring new coping strategies (growth). We propose Semantic Recovery Velocity (SRV), a novel metric quantifying the rate users move away from initial distress-focused posts in embedding space. Analyzing 15,847 r/depression trajectories and validating against multiple proxies, we demonstrate topological features predict self-reported improvement with 78.3% accuracy, outperforming sentiment baselines. This work contributes: (1) a TDA methodology for HCI mental health research, (2) interpretable topological signatures, and (3) design implications for adaptive mental health platforms with ethical guardrails.

Abstract: Why do some speakers capture a room almost instantly while others fail to connect? The real-time architecture of audience engagement remains largely a black box. Here, we used motion-captured animations to present the pure nonverbal performance of public speakers to audiences - either in silence (nonverbal-only) or paired with the verbal content (nonverbal-plus-verbal). Using continuous response measurement (CRM), we find that audience judgments solidify with remarkable speed: Moment-to-moment engagement ratings become highly predictive of subsequent evaluations within the initial 10 seconds of the performance. Most notably, this predictive relationship emerged faster and slightly stronger in the nonverbal-only condition, with predictive information being present already after less than 5 seconds. These findings elucidate the social impact a speaker's nonverbal performance has on audience impressions, even when dissociated from the verbal content of the speech. Our approach provides a high-resolution temporal map of social impression formation, pointing to an early "moment of capture" that appears to set the stage for the reception of the following message. On a broader scale, this research validates a powerful new method to isolate different communicative channels, to scientifically deconstruct rhetorical skill, and to study the pervasive impact of nonverbal behavior more broadly. It also enables us to translate the ancient art of rhetoric into a modern science of social impression formation, yielding an empirical basis that can inform human-centered feedback, develop AI-based augmentation tools, and guide the design of engaging, socially present avatars in an increasingly AI-mediated and virtual world.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Sycophancy, the tendency of large language models to favour user-affirming responses over critical engagement, has been identified as an alignment failure, particularly in high-stakes advisory and social contexts. While prior work has documented conversational features correlated with sycophancy, we lack a systematic understanding of what provokes or prevents AI sycophancy. Here, we present a set of controlled experimental studies where we first isolate how input framing influences sycophancy, and second, leverage these findings to develop mitigation strategies. In a nested factorial design, we compare questions to various non-questions where we vary three orthogonal factors: epistemic certainty (statement, belief, conviction), perspective (I- vs user-perspective), and affirmation vs negation. We show that (1) sycophancy is substantially higher in response to non-questions compared to questions. Additionally, we find that (2) sycophancy increases monotonically with epistemic certainty conveyed by the user, and (3) is amplified by I-perspective framing. Building on this, we show that asking a model to convert non-questions into questions before answering significantly reduces sycophancy. Importantly, this effect is stronger than a simple baseline prompt asking models "not to be sycophantic". Our work offers a practical and effective input-level mitigation that both developers and users can easily adopt.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Interest-based learning (IBL) is a paradigm of instruction in which educational content is contextualized using learners' interests to enhance content relevance. IBL has been shown to result in improved learning outcomes. Unfortunately, high effort is needed for instructors to design and deliver IBL content for individual students. LLMs in the form of AI tutors may allow for IBL to scale across many students. Designing an AI tutor for IBL, however, first requires an understanding of how IBL is implemented in teaching scenarios. This paper presents a study that seeks to derive this understanding from an analysis of how human instructors design and deliver IBL content. We studied 14 one-to-one online tutoring sessions (28 participants) in which tutors designed and delivered a lesson tailored to a student's self-identified interest. Using lesson artifacts, tutoring transcripts, interviews, and questionnaires, findings include themes on how tutors integrate interests during instruction and why. Finally, actionable design implications are presented for LLM-powered AI tutors that aim to deliver IBL at scale.

Abstract: While prior research has focused on providers, caregivers, and adult patients, little is known about adolescents' perceptions of AI in health learning and management. Utilizing design fiction and co-design methods, we conducted seven workshops with 23 adolescents (aged 14-17) to understand how they anticipate using health AI in the context of a family celiac diagnosis. Our findings reveal that adolescents have four main envisioned roles of health AI: enhancing health understanding and help-seeking, reducing cognitive burden, supporting family health management, and providing guidance while respecting their autonomy. We also identified nuanced trust and a divided view on emotional support from health AI. These findings suggest that adolescents perceive AI's value as a tool that moves them from efficiency to meaning-one that creates time for valued activities. We discuss opportunities for future health AI systems to be designed to encourage adolescent autonomy and reflection, while also supporting meaningful, dialectical activities.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Teleoperated quadruped robots are increasingly deployed in safety-critical missions -- industrial inspection, military reconnaissance, and emergency response -- yet the security of their communication and control infrastructure remains insufficiently characterized. Quadrupeds present distinct security challenges arising from dynamic stability constraints, gait-dependent vulnerability windows, substantial kinetic energy, and elevated operator cognitive load.
  This survey synthesizes peer-reviewed literature and vulnerability disclosures (2019--2025) to provide comprehensive analysis of cybersecurity threats, consequences, and countermeasures for teleoperated quadruped systems. We contribute: (i) a six-layer attack taxonomy spanning perception manipulation, VR/AR operator targeting, communication disruption, control signal attacks, localization spoofing, and network intrusion; (ii) systematic attack-to-consequence mapping with timing characterization; (iii) Technology Readiness Level classification exposing critical maturity gaps between field-deployed communication protections (TRL 7--9) and experimental perception/operator-layer defenses (TRL 3--5); (iv) comparative security analysis of six commercial platforms; (v) pragmatic deployment guidance stratified by implementation timeline; and (vi) eight prioritized research gaps with implementation roadmaps.
  Limitations: Platform assessments rely on publicly available information. Attack success rates derive from cited studies under controlled conditions and require domain-specific validation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The specification of the action space plays a pivotal role in imitation-based robotic manipulation policy learning, fundamentally shaping the optimization landscape of policy learning. While recent advances have focused heavily on scaling training data and model capacity, the choice of action space remains guided by ad-hoc heuristics or legacy designs, leading to an ambiguous understanding of robotic policy design philosophies. To address this ambiguity, we conducted a large-scale and systematic empirical study, confirming that the action space does have significant and complex impacts on robotic policy learning. We dissect the action design space along temporal and spatial axes, facilitating a structured analysis of how these choices govern both policy learnability and control stability. Based on 13,000+ real-world rollouts on a bimanual robot and evaluation on 500+ trained models over four scenarios, we examine the trade-offs between absolute vs. delta representations, and joint-space vs. task-space parameterizations. Our large-scale results suggest that properly designing the policy to predict delta actions consistently improves performance, while joint-space and task-space representations offer complementary strengths, favoring control stability and generalization, respectively.

Abstract: Soft robots enable safe, adaptive interaction with complex environments but remain difficult to sense and control due to their highly deformable structures. Architected soft materials such as helicoid lattices offer tunable stiffness and strength but are challenging to instrument because of their sparse geometry. We introduce a fabrication method for embedding air channels into helicoid-based soft continuum robots. Multi-material segments fabricated via vision-controlled jetting in a single print interface with PCBs housing miniature pressure sensors and IMUs for distributed deformation sensing. We characterize the mechanical properties of four helicoid designs and validate the sensor response to fundamental deformation modes. To demonstrate the platform's scalability, we construct and mechanically evaluate a meter-scale, 14-DoF cable-driven soft arm capable of open-loop trajectory tracking and object grasping, with tactile-based stiffness detection demonstrated using the gripper sensors. This approach establishes a scalable fabrication strategy for sensorized architected materials in large-scale soft robotic systems.

Abstract: Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) are a powerful tool for ensuring robotic safety, but designing or learning valid CBFs for complex systems is a significant challenge. While Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability provides a formal method for synthesizing safe value functions, it scales poorly and is typically performed offline, limiting its applicability in dynamic environments. This paper bridges the gap between offline synthesis and online adaptation. We introduce refineCBF for refining an approximate CBF - whether analytically derived, learned, or even unsafe - via warm-started HJ reachability. We then present its computationally efficient successor, HJ-Patch, which accelerates this process through localized updates. Both methods guarantee the recovery of a safe value function and can ensure monotonic safety improvements during adaptation. Our experiments validate our framework's primary contribution: in-the-loop, real-time adaptation, in simulation (with detailed value function analysis) and on physical hardware. Our experiments on ground vehicles and quadcopters show that our framework can successfully adapt to sudden environmental changes, such as new obstacles and unmodeled wind disturbances, providing a practical path toward deploying formally guaranteed safety in real-world settings.

Abstract: Collecting a high-quality dataset is a critical task that demands meticulous attention to detail, as overlooking certain aspects can render the entire dataset unusable. Autonomous driving challenges remain a prominent area of research, requiring further exploration to enhance the perception and planning performance of vehicles. However, existing datasets are often incomplete. For instance, datasets that include perception information generally lack planning data, while planning datasets typically consist of extensive driving sequences where the ego vehicle predominantly drives forward, offering limited behavioral diversity. In addition, many real datasets struggle to evaluate their models, especially for planning tasks, since they lack a proper closed-loop evaluation setup. The CARLA Leaderboard 2.0 challenge, which provides a diverse set of scenarios to address the long-tail problem in autonomous driving, has emerged as a valuable alternative platform for developing perception and planning models in both open-loop and closed-loop evaluation setups. Nevertheless, existing datasets collected on this platform present certain limitations. Some datasets appear to be tailored primarily for limited sensor configuration, with particular sensor configurations. To support end-to-end autonomous driving research, we have collected a new dataset comprising over 2.85 million frames using the CARLA simulation environment for the diverse Leaderboard 2.0 challenge scenarios. Our dataset is designed not only for planning tasks but also supports dynamic object detection, lane divider detection, centerline detection, traffic light recognition, prediction tasks and visual language action models . Furthermore, we demonstrate its versatility by training various models using our dataset. Moreover, we also provide numerical rarity scores to understand how rarely the current state occurs in the dataset.

Abstract: Reachability analysis has become increasingly important in robotics to distinguish safe from unsafe states. Unfortunately, existing reachability and safety analysis methods often fall short, as they typically require known system dynamics or large datasets to estimate accurate system models, are computationally expensive, and assume full state information. A recent method, called MORALS, aims to address these shortcomings by using topological tools to estimate3DR-eEgnciodnesr of Attraction (ROA) in a low-dimensional latent space. However, MORALS still relies on full state knowledge and has not been studied when only sensor measurements are available. This paper presents Visual Morse Graph-Aided Estimation of Regions of Attraction in a Learned Latent Space (V- MORALS). V-MORALS takes in a dataset of image-based trajectories of a system under a given controller, and learns a latent space for reachability analysis. Using this learned latent space, our method is able to generate well-defined Morse Graphs, from which we can compute ROAs for various systems and controllers. V-MORALS provides capabilities similar to the original MORALS architecture without relying on state knowledge, and using only high-level sensor data.

Abstract: Aerial manipulators extend the reach and manipulation capabilities of uncrewed multirotor aerial vehicles for inspection, agriculture, sampling, and delivery. Continuum arm aerial manipulation systems offer lightweight, dexterous, and compliant interaction opportunities. Existing designs allow manipulation only below the UAV which restricts their deployability in multiple directions and through clutter. They are also sensitive to propeller downwash. Addressing these limitations, we present Tilt-X, a continuum arm aerial manipulator that integrates a tilting mechanism, a telescopic stage, and a cable-driven continuum section. We present its design and kinematic model and validate it through flight demonstrations. Tilt-X enables a volumetric workspace with up to 75 mm extension and planar orientations between 0$^\circ$ to 90$^\circ$. Experiments comparing end effector pose with and without downwash quantitatively measure its accuracy, providing critical evidence to guide the design and control of reliable aerial manipulators. Results show stabilisation of end effector pose as the manipulator extends out of the propeller influence zone.

Abstract: The reliance on language in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models introduces ambiguity, cognitive overhead, and difficulties in precise object identification and sequential task execution, particularly in environments with multiple visually similar objects. To address these limitations, we propose Vision-Click-Action (VCA), a framework that replaces verbose textual commands with direct, click-based visual interaction using pretrained segmentation models. By allowing operators to specify target objects clearly through visual selection in the robot's 2D camera view, VCA reduces interpretation errors, lowers cognitive load, and provides a practical and scalable alternative to language-driven interfaces for real-world robotic manipulation. Experimental results validate that the proposed VCA framework achieves effective instance-level manipulation of specified target objects. Experiment videos are available at https://robrosinc.github.io/vca/.

Abstract: Memory-augmented Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capability for complex and long-horizon embodied planning. By keeping track of past experiences and environmental states, memory enables LLMs to maintain a global view, thereby avoiding repetitive exploration. However, existing approaches often store the memory as raw text, leading to excessively long prompts and high prefill latency. While it is possible to store and reuse the KV caches, the efficiency benefits are greatly undermined due to frequent KV cache updates. In this paper, we propose KEEP, a KV-cache-centric memory management system for efficient embodied planning. KEEP features 3 key innovations: (1) a Static-Dynamic Memory Construction algorithm that reduces KV cache recomputation by mixed-granularity memory group; (2) a Multi-hop Memory Re-computation algorithm that dynamically identifies important cross-attention among different memory groups and reconstructs memory interactions iteratively; (3) a Layer-balanced Memory Loading that eliminates unbalanced KV cache loading and cross-attention computation across different layers. Extensive experimental results have demonstrated that KEEP achieves 2.68x speedup with negligible accuracy loss compared with text-based memory methods on ALFRED dataset. Compared with the KV re-computation method CacheBlend (EuroSys'25), KEEP shows 4.13% success rate improvement and 1.90x time-to-first-token (TTFT) reduction.

Abstract: Magnetic rolling microrobots enable gentle manipulation in confined microfluidic environments, yet autonomy for contact-rich behaviors such as cell pushing and multi-target assembly remains difficult to develop and evaluate reproducibly. We present MicroPush, an open-source simulator and benchmark suite for magnetic rolling microrobots in cluttered 2D scenes. MicroPush combines an overdamped interaction model with contact-aware stick--slip effects, lightweight near-field damping, optional Poiseuille background flow, and a calibrated mapping from actuation frequency to free-space rolling speed. On top of the simulator core, we provide a modular planning--control stack with a two-phase strategy for contact establishment and goal-directed pushing, together with a deterministic benchmark protocol with fixed tasks, staged execution, and unified CSV logging for single-object transport and hexagonal assembly. We report success, time, and tracking metrics, and an actuation-variation measure $E_{Δω}$. Results show that controller stability dominates performance under flow disturbances, while planner choice can influence command smoothness over long-horizon sequences via waypoint progression. MicroPush enables reproducible comparison and ablation of planning, control, and learning methods for microscale contact-rich micromanipulation.

Abstract: Force/torque feedback can substantially improve Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models on contact-rich manipulation, but most existing approaches fuse all modalities at a single operating frequency. This design ignores the mismatched sampling rates of real robot sensors, forcing downsampling of the high-frequency contact cues needed for reactive correction. Combined with common VLM-action-expert (AE) pipelines that execute action chunks largely open loop between expensive VLM updates, unified-frequency fusion often yields delayed responses to impacts, stick-slip, and force spikes. We propose FAVLA, a force-adaptive fast-slow VLA that decouples slow perception planning from fast contact-aware control. FAVLA runs a slow VLM at a fixed low frequency to encode modalities to produce latent representations and to predict near-future force variation. A fast AE then executes at a variable high frequency, conditioning on the latest force sequence data to generate reactive actions. We further introduce a force adapter that injects high-frequency force features into multiple AE layers, and adaptively schedules the AE's execution frequency based on the VLM's predicted force variation. Extensive experiments on contact-rich tasks demonstrate that FAVLA significantly outperforms baselines, achieving superior reactivity and success rates, especially with a smaller contact force during manipulation.

Abstract: High-speed event-driven tactile sensors are essential for achieving human-like dynamic manipulation, yet their integration is often limited by the bulkiness of standard event cameras. This paper presents SpikingTac, a miniaturized, highly integrated neuromorphic tactile sensor featuring a custom standalone event camera module, achieved with a total material cost of less than \$150. We construct a global dynamic state map coupled with an unsupervised denoising network to enable precise tracking at a 1000~Hz perception rate and 350~Hz tracking frequency. Addressing the viscoelastic hysteresis of silicone elastomers, we propose a hysteresis-aware incremental update law with a spatial gain damping mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate exceptional zero-point stability, achieving a 100\% return-to-origin success rate with a minimal mean bias of 0.8039 pixels, even under extreme torsional deformations. In dynamic tasks, SpikingTac limits the obstacle-avoidance overshoot to 6.2~mm, representing a 5-fold performance improvement over conventional frame-based sensors. Furthermore, the sensor achieves sub-millimeter geometric accuracy, with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.0952~mm in localization and 0.0452~mm in radius measurement.

Abstract: Pneumatic artificial muscles (PAMs) enable compliant actuation for soft wearable, assistive, and interactive robots. When arranged antagonistically, PAMs can provide variable impedance through co-contraction but exhibit coupled, nonlinear, and hysteretic dynamics that challenge modeling and control. This paper presents a hybrid neural ordinary differential equation (Neural ODE) framework that embeds physical structure into a learned model of antagonistic PAM dynamics. The formulation combines parametric joint mechanics and pneumatic state dynamics with a neural network force component that captures antagonistic coupling and rate-dependent hysteresis. The forward model predicts joint motion and chamber pressures with a mean R$^2$ of 0.88 across 225 co-contraction conditions. An inverse formulation, derived from the learned dynamics, computes pressure commands offline for desired motion and stiffness profiles, tracked in closed loop during execution. Experimental validation demonstrates reliable stiffness control across 126-176 N/mm and consistent impedance behavior across operating velocities, in contrast to a static model, which shows degraded stiffness consistency at higher velocities.

Abstract: Human operators are still frequently exposed to hazardous environments such as disaster zones and industrial facilities, where intuitive and reliable teleoperation of mobile robots and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is essential. In this context, hands-free teleoperation enhances operator mobility and situational awareness, thereby improving safety in hazardous environments. While vision-based gesture recognition has been explored as one method for hands-free teleoperation, its performance often deteriorates under occlusions, lighting variations, and cluttered backgrounds, limiting its applicability in real-world operations. To overcome these limitations, we propose a multimodal gesture recognition framework that integrates inertial data (accelerometer, gyroscope, and orientation) from Apple Watches on both wrists with capacitive sensing signals from custom gloves. We design a late fusion strategy based on the log-likelihood ratio (LLR), which not only enhances recognition performance but also provides interpretability by quantifying modality-specific contributions. To support this research, we introduce a new dataset of 20 distinct gestures inspired by aircraft marshalling signals, comprising synchronized RGB video, IMU, and capacitive sensor data. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves performance comparable to a state-of-the-art vision-based baseline while significantly reducing computational cost, model size, and training time, making it well suited for real-time robot control. We therefore underscore the potential of sensor-based multimodal fusion as a robust and interpretable solution for gesture-driven mobile robot and drone teleoperation.

Abstract: Reliable navigation systems are not available indoors, such as in campuses and small areas. Users must depend on confusing, time-consuming static signage or floor maps. In this paper, an AR-based technique has been applied to campus and small-site navigation, where Vuforia Area Target is used for environment modeling. AI navigation's NavMesh component is used for navigation purposes, and the A* algorithm is used within this component for shortest path calculation. Compared to Dijkstra's algorithm, it can reach a solution about two to three times faster for smaller search spaces. In many cases, Dijkstra's algorithm has difficulty performing well in high-complexity environments where memory usage grows and processing times increase. Compared to older approaches such as GPS, real-time processing and AR overlays can be combined to provide intuitive directions for users while dynamically updating the path in response to environmental changes. Experimental results indicate significantly improved navigation accuracy, better user experience, and greater efficiency compared to traditional methods. These results show that AR technology integrated with existing pathfinding algorithms is feasible and scalable, making it a user-friendly solution for indoor navigation. Although highly effective in limited and defined indoor spaces, further optimization of NavMesh is required for large or highly dynamic environments.

Abstract: In UAV dynamic decision, complex and variable hazardous factors pose severe challenges to the generalization capability of algorithms. Despite offering semantic understanding and scene generalization, Large Language Models (LLM) lack domain-specific UAV control knowledge and formal safety assurances, restricting their direct applicability. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a train-free two-layer decision architecture based on LLMs, integrating high-level safety planning with low-level precise control. The framework introduces three key contributions: 1) A fuzzy Control Barrier Function verification mechanism for semantically-augmented actions, providing provable safety certification for LLM outputs. 2) A star-hierarchical graph-based retrieval-augmented generation system, enabling efficient, elastic, and interpretable scene adaptation. 3) Systematic experimental validation in pursuit-evasion scenarios with unknown obstacles and emergent threats, demonstrating that our SAGE-LLM maintains performance while significantly enhancing safety and generalization without online training. The proposed framework demonstrates strong extensibility, suggesting its potential for generalization to broader embodied intelligence systems and safety-critical control domains.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models integrate visual observations and language instructions to predict robot actions, demonstrating promising generalization in manipulation tasks. However, most existing approaches primarily rely on direct mappings from 2D visual inputs to action sequences, without explicitly modeling the underlying 3D spatial structure or temporal world dynamics. Such representations may limit spatial reasoning and long-horizon decision-making in dynamic environments. To address this limitation, we propose StemVLA, a novel framework that explicitly incorporates both future-oriented 3D spatial knowledge and historical 4D spatiotemporal representations into action prediction. First, instead of relying solely on observed images, StemVLA forecasts structured 3D future spatial-geometric world knowledge, enabling the model to anticipate upcoming scene geometry and object configurations. Second, to capture temporal consistency and motion dynamics, we feed historical image frames into a pretrained video-geometry transformer backbone to extract implicit 3D world representations, and further aggregate them across time using a temporal attention module, termed VideoFormer [20], forming a unified 4D historical spatiotemporal representation. By jointly modeling 2D observations, predicted 3D future structure, and aggregated 4D temporal dynamics, StemVLA enables more comprehensive world understanding for robot manipulation. Extensive experiments in simulation demonstrate that StemVLA significantly improves long-horizon task success and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CALVIN ABC-D benchmark [46], achieving an average sequence length of XXX.

Abstract: Acceleration-commanded guidance laws (e.g., proportional navigation) are attractive for high-level decision making, but their direct deployment on fixed-wing UAVs is challenging because accelerations are not directly actuated and must be realized through attitude and thrust under flight-envelope constraints. This paper presents an acceleration-level outer-loop control framework that converts commanded tangential and normal accelerations into executable body-rate and normalized thrust commands compatible with mainstream autopilots (e.g., PX4/APM). For the normal channel, we derive an engineering mapping from the desired normal acceleration to roll- and pitch-rate commands that regulate the direction and magnitude of the lift vector under small-angle assumptions. For the tangential channel, we introduce an energy-based formulation inspired by total energy control and identify an empirical thrust-energy acceleration relationship directly from flight data, avoiding explicit propulsion modeling or thrust bench calibration. We further discuss priority handling between normal and tangential accelerations under saturation and non-level maneuvers. Extensive real-flight experiments on a VTOL fixed-wing platform demonstrate accurate acceleration tracking and enable practical implementation of proportional navigation using only body-rate and normalized thrust interfaces.

Abstract: Learning motion tracking from rich human motion data is a foundational task for achieving general control in humanoid robots, enabling them to perform diverse behaviors. However, discrepancies in morphology and dynamics between humans and robots, combined with data noise, introduce physically infeasible artifacts in reference motions, such as floating and penetration. During both training and execution, these artifacts create a conflict between following inaccurate reference motions and maintaining the robot's stability, hindering the development of a generalizable motion tracking policy. To address these challenges, we introduce OmniTrack, a general tracking framework that explicitly decouples physical feasibility from general motion tracking. In the first stage, a privileged generalist policy generates physically plausible motions that strictly adhere to the robot's dynamics via trajectory rollout in simulation. In the second stage, the general control policy is trained to track these physically feasible motions, ensuring stable and coherent control transfer to the real robot. Experiments show that OmniTrack improves tracking accuracy and demonstrates strong generalization to unseen motions. In real-world tests, OmniTrack achieves hour-long, consistent, and stable tracking, including complex acrobatic motions such as flips and cartwheels. Additionally, we show that OmniTrack supports human-style stable and dynamic online teleoperation, highlighting its robustness and adaptability to varying user inputs.

Abstract: High-fidelity motion tracking serves as the ultimate litmus test for generalizable, human-level motor skills. However, current policies often hit a "generality barrier": as motion libraries scale in diversity, tracking fidelity inevitably collapses - especially for real-world deployment of high-dynamic motions. We identify this failure as the result of two compounding factors: the learning bottleneck in scaling multi-motion optimization and the physical executability constraints that arise in real-world actuation. To overcome these challenges, we introduce OmniXtreme, a scalable framework that decouples general motor skill learning from sim-to-real physical skill refinement. Our approach uses a flow-matching policy with high-capacity architectures to scale representation capacity without interference-intensive multi-motion RL optimization, followed by an actuation-aware refinement phase that ensures robust performance on physical hardware. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniXtreme maintains high-fidelity tracking across diverse, high-difficulty datasets. On real robots, the unified policy successfully executes multiple extreme motions, effectively breaking the long-standing fidelity-scalability trade-off in high-dynamic humanoid control.

Abstract: Precise grasp force regulation in tendon-driven surgical instruments is fundamentally limited by nonlinear coupling between motor dynamics, transmission compliance, friction, and distal mechanics. Existing solutions typically rely on distal force sensing or analytical compensation, increasing hardware complexity or degrading performance under dynamic motion. We present a sensorless control framework that combines physics-consistent modeling and hybrid reinforcement learning to achieve high-precision distal force regulation in a proximally actuated surgical end-effector. We develop a first-principles digital twin of the da Vinci Xi grasping mechanism that captures coupled electrical, transmission, and jaw dynamics within a unified differential-algebraic formulation. To safely learn control policies in this stiff and highly nonlinear system, we introduce a three-stage pipeline:(i)a receding-horizon CMA-ES oracle that generates dynamically feasible expert trajectories,(ii)fully offline policy learning via Implicit Q-Learning to ensure stable initialization without unsafe exploration, and (iii)online refinement using TD3 for adaptation to on-policy dynamics. The resulting policy directly maps proximal measurements to motor voltages and requires no distal sensing. In simulation, the controller maintains grasp force within 1% of the desired reference during multi-harmonic jaw motion. Hardware experiments demonstrate average force errors below 4% across diverse trajectories, validating sim-to-real transfer. The learned policy contains approximately 71k param and executes at kH rates, enabling real-time deployment. These results demonstrate that high-fidelity modeling combined with structured offline-online RL can recover precise distal force behavior without additional sensing, offering a scalable and mechanically compatible solution for surgical robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Safe and efficient autonomous driving in dense traffic is fundamentally a decentralized multi-agent coordination problem, where interactions at conflict points such as merging and weaving must be resolved reliably under partial observability. With only local and incomplete cues, interaction patterns can change rapidly, often causing unstable behaviors such as oscillatory yielding or unsafe commitments. Existing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches either adopt synchronous decision-making, which exacerbate non-stationarity, or depend on centralized sequencing mechanisms that scale poorly as traffic density increases. To address these limitations, we propose Topology-conditioned Stackelberg Coordination (TSC), a learning framework for decentralized interactive driving under communication-free execution, which extracts a time-varying directed priority graph from braid-inspired weaving relations between trajectories, thereby defining local leader-follower dependencies without constructing a global order of play. Conditioned on this graph, TSC endogenously factorizes dense interactions into graph-local Stackelberg subgames and, under centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE), learns a sequential coordination policy that anticipates leaders via action prediction and trains followers through action-conditioned value learning to approximate local best responses, improving training stability and safety in dense traffic. Experiments across four dense traffic scenarios show that TSC achieves superior performance over representative MARL baselines across key metrics, most notably reducing collisions while maintaining competitive traffic efficiency and control smoothness.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation requires policies that are smooth and responsive to evolving observations. However, synchronous inference in the raw action space introduces several challenges, including intra-chunk jitter, inter-chunk discontinuities, and stop-and-go execution. These issues undermine a policy's smoothness and its responsiveness to environmental changes. We propose ABPolicy, an asynchronous flow-matching policy that operates in a B-spline control-point action space. First, the B-spline representation ensures intra-chunk smoothness. Second, we introduce bidirectional action prediction coupled with refitting optimization to enforce inter-chunk continuity. Finally, by leveraging asynchronous inference, ABPolicy delivers real-time, continuous updates. We evaluate ABPolicy across seven tasks encompassing both static settings and dynamic settings with moving objects. Empirical results indicate that ABPolicy reduces trajectory jerk, leading to smoother motion and improved performance. Project website: https://teee000.github.io/ABPolicy/.

Abstract: The swiftly expanding retail sector is increasingly adopting autonomous mobile robots empowered by artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to gain an edge in the competitive market. However, these autonomous robots encounter challenges in adapting to the dynamic nature of retail products, often struggling to operate autonomously in novel situations. In this study, we introduce an omni-directional dual-arm mobile robot specifically tailored for use in retail environments. Additionally, we propose a tele-operation method that enables shared control between the robot and a human operator. This approach utilizes a Virtual Reality (VR) motion capture system to capture the operator's commands, which are then transmitted to the robot located remotely in a retail setting. Furthermore, the robot is equipped with heterogeneous grippers on both manipulators, facilitating the handling of a wide range of items. We validate the efficacy of the proposed system through testing in a mockup of retail environment, demonstrating its ability to manipulate various commonly encountered retail items using both single and dual-arm coordinated manipulation techniques.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel autonomous robotic assembly framework for constructing stable structures without relying on predefined architectural blueprints. Instead of following fixed plans, construction tasks are defined through targets and obstacles, allowing the system to adapt more flexibly to environmental uncertainty and variations during the building process. A reinforcement learning (RL) policy, trained using deep Q-learning with successor features, serves as the decision-making component. As a proof of concept, we evaluate the approach on a benchmark of 15 2D robotic assembly tasks of discrete block construction. Experiments using a real-world closed-loop robotic setup demonstrate the feasibility of the method and its ability to handle construction noise. The results suggest that our framework offers a promising direction for more adaptable and robust robotic construction in real-world environments.

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) agents often struggle with long-horizon reasoning in unseen environments, particularly when facing ambiguous, coarse-grained instructions. While recent advances use knowledge graph to enhance reasoning, the potential of multimodal event knowledge inspired by human episodic memory remains underexplored. In this work, we propose an event-centric knowledge enhancement strategy for automated process knowledge mining and feature fusion to solve coarse-grained instruction and long-horizon reasoning in VLN task. First, we construct YE-KG, the first large-scale multimodal spatiotemporal knowledge graph, with over 86k nodes and 83k edges, derived from real-world indoor videos. By leveraging multimodal large language models (i.e., LLaVa, GPT4), we extract unstructured video streams into structured semantic-action-effect events to serve as explicit episodic memory. Second, we introduce STE-VLN, which integrates the above graph into VLN models via a Coarse-to-Fine Hierarchical Retrieval mechanism. This allows agents to retrieve causal event sequences and dynamically fuse them with egocentric visual observations. Experiments on REVERIE, R2R, and R2R-CE benchmarks demonstrate the efficiency of our event-centric strategy, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches across diverse action spaces.

Abstract: The ability to achieve and maintain inverted poses is essential for unlocking the full agility of miniature blimp robots (MBRs). However, developing reliable control methods for MBRs remains challenging due to their complex and underactuated dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that enables robust control policy learning for inverted pose on MBRs. The proposed framework operates through three core stages: First, a high-fidelity three-dimensional (3D) simulation environment was constructed, which was calibrated against real-world MBR motion data to ensure accurate replication of inverted-state dynamics. Second, a robust policy for MBR inverted control was trained within the simulation environment via a domain randomization strategy and a modified Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm. Third, a mapping layer was designed to bridge the sim-to-real gap for the learned policy deployment. Comprehensive evaluations in the simulation environment demonstrate that the learned policy achieves a higher success rate compared to the energy-shaping controller. Furthermore, experimental results confirm that the learned policy with a mapping layer enables an MBR to achieve and maintain a fully upside-down pose in real-world settings.

Abstract: This paper introduces an online inspection algorithm that enables an autonomous UAV to fly around a transmission tower and obtain detailed inspection images without a prior map of the tower. Our algorithm relies on camera-LiDAR sensor fusion for online detection and localization of insulators. In particular, the algorithm is based on insulator detection using a convolutional neural network, projection of LiDAR points onto the image, and filtering them using the bounding boxes. The detection pipeline is coupled with several proposed insulator localization methods based on DBSCAN, RANSAC, and PCA algorithms. The performance of the proposed online inspection algorithm and camera-LiDAR sensor fusion pipeline is demonstrated through simulation and real-world flights. In simulation, we showed that our single-flight inspection strategy can save up to 24 % of total inspection time, compared to the two-flight strategy of scanning the tower and afterwards visiting the inspection waypoints in the optimal way. In a real-world experiment, the best performing proposed method achieves a mean horizontal and vertical localization error for the insulator of 0.16 +- 0.08 m and 0.16 +- 0.11 m, respectively. Compared to the most relevant approach, the proposed method achieves more than an order of magnitude lower variance in horizontal insulator localization error.

Abstract: Autonomous drone racing has attracted increasing interest as a research topic for exploring the limits of agile flight. However, existing studies primarily focus on obstacle-free racetracks, while the perception and dynamic challenges introduced by obstacles remain underexplored, often resulting in low success rates and limited robustness in real-world flight. To this end, we propose a novel vision-based curriculum reinforcement learning framework for training a robust controller capable of addressing unseen obstacles in drone racing. We combine multi-stage cu rriculum learning, domain randomization, and a multi-scene updating strategy to address the conflicting challenges of obstacle avoidance and gate traversal. Our end-to-end control policy is implemented as a single network, allowing high-speed flight of quadrotors in environments with variable obstacles. Both hardware-in-the-loop and real-world experiments demonstrate that our method achieves faster lap times and higher success rates than existing approaches, effectively advancing drone racing in obstacle-rich environments.

Abstract: Soft pneumatic actuators enable safe human-machine interaction with lightweight and powerful applied parts. On the other side, they suffer design limitations as regards complex actuation patterns, including minimum bending radii, multi-states capabilities and structural stability. We present geometry-based pneumatic actuators (GPAs), a design and implementation approach that introduces constraint layers with configurable CNC heat-sealed chambers. The approach achieves predictable deformation, near-zero bending radii, multi-states actuation, and enables customizable and repeatable complex actuated geometries. Mathematical modeling reveals predictable linear angle transformations and validates nonlinear torque-angle relationships across diverse configurations. We demonstrate versatility of the GPAs approach through three applications: a 49 g wrist exoskeleton reducing muscle activity by up to 51%, a 30.8 g haptic interface delivering 8 N force feedback with fast response, and a 208 g bipedal robot achieving multi-gait locomotion. GPAs establish a configurable platform for next-generation wearable robotics, haptic systems, and soft locomotion devices.

Abstract: Observational learning requires an agent to learn to perform a task by referencing only observations of the performed task. This work investigates the equivalent setting in real-world robot learning where access to hand-designed rewards and demonstrator actions are not assumed. To address this data-constrained setting, this work presents a planning-based Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) algorithm for world modeling from observation and interaction alone. Experiments conducted entirely in the real-world demonstrate that this paradigm is effective for learning image-based manipulation tasks from scratch in under an hour, without assuming prior knowledge, pre-training, or data of any kind beyond task observations. Moreover, this work demonstrates that the learned world model representation is capable of online transfer learning in the real-world from scratch. In comparison to existing approaches, including IRL, RL, and Behavior Cloning (BC), which have more restrictive assumptions, the proposed approach demonstrates significantly greater sample efficiency and success rates, enabling a practical path forward for online world modeling and planning from observation and interaction.

Abstract: Vision-language action (VLA) policies often report strong manipulation benchmark performance with relatively few demonstrations, but it remains unclear whether this reflects robust language-to-object grounding or reliance on object--location correlations that do not transfer beyond the training distribution. We present a controlled multi-object picking study that progressively increases object placement variability up to full workspace randomization and evaluates held-out object--location pairings that break familiar associations without increasing spatial difficulty. Across these stress tests and data scaling, we find that for representative VLA policies, including SmolVLA and $π_{0.5}$, execution of the manipulation primitive remains substantially more reliable than instruction-conditioned task success in harder regimes, suggesting that manipulation skill acquisition is decoupled from instruction following. We recommend augmenting manipulation benchmarks with task ladders and decomposed metrics that separately measure primitive execution and instruction-conditioned success to better diagnose instruction-grounded generalization.

Abstract: Humanoid robots have become a focal point of technological ambition, with claims of surgical capability within years in mainstream discourse. These projections are aspirational yet lack empirical grounding. To date, no humanoid has assisted a surgeon through an actual procedure, let alone performed one. The work described here breaks this new ground. Here we report a proof of concept in which a teleoperated Unitree G1 provided endoscopic visualization while an attending otolaryngologist performed a cadaveric sphenoidectomy. The procedure was completed successfully, with stable visualization maintained throughout. Teleoperation allowed assessment of whether the humanoid form factor could meet the physical demands of surgical assistance in terms of sustenance and precision; the cognitive demands were satisfied -- for now -- by the operator. Post-procedure analysis identified engineering targets for clinical translation, alongside near-term opportunities such as autonomous diagnostic scoping. This work establishes form-factor feasibility for humanoid surgical assistance while identifying challenges for continued development.

Abstract: Reliable radar inertial odometry (RIO) requires mitigating IMU bias drift, a challenge that intensifies in subterranean environments due to extreme temperatures and gravity-induced accelerations. Cost-effective IMUs such as the Pixhawk, when paired with FMCW TI IWR6843AOP EVM radars, suffer from drift-induced degradation compounded by sparse, noisy, and flickering radar returns, making fusion less stable than LiDAR-based odometry. Yet, LiDAR fails under smoke, dust, and aerosols, whereas FMCW radars remain compact, lightweight, cost-effective, and robust in these situations. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage MRIO framework that combines an IMU bias estimator for resilient localization and mapping in GPS-denied subterranean environments affected by smoke. Radar-based ego-velocity estimation is formulated through a least-squares approach and incorporated into an EKF for online IMU bias correction; the corrected IMU accelerations are fused with heterogeneous measurements from multiple radars and an IMU to refine odometry. The proposed framework further supports radar-only mapping by exploiting the robot's estimated translational and rotational displacements. In subterranean field trials, MRIO delivers robust localization and mapping, outperforming EKF-RIO. It maintains accuracy across cost-efficient FMCW radar setups and different IMUs, showing resilience with Pixhawk and higher-grade units such as VectorNav. The implementation will be provided as an open-source resource to the community (code available at https://github.com/LTU-RAI/MRIO

Abstract: Soft, tip-extending vine robots are well suited for navigating tight, debris-filled environments, making them ideal for urban search and rescue. Sensing the full shape of a vine robot's body is helpful both for localizing information from other sensors placed along the robot body and for determining the robot's configuration within the space being explored. Prior approaches have localized vine robot tips using a single inertial measurement unit (IMU) combined with force sensing or length estimation, while one method demonstrated full-body shape sensing using distributed IMUs on a passively steered robot in controlled maze environments. However, the accuracy of distributed IMU-based shape sensing under active steering, varying robot lengths, and different sensor spacings has not been systematically quantified. In this work, we experimentally evaluate the accuracy of vine robot shape sensing using distributed IMUs along the robot body. We quantify IMU drift, measuring an average orientation drift rate of 1.33 degrees/min across 15 sensors. For passive steering, mean tip position error was 11% of robot length. For active steering, mean tip position error increased to 16%. During growth experiments across lengths from 30-175 cm, mean tip error was 8%, with a positive trend with increasing length. We also analyze the influence of sensor spacing and observe that intermediate spacings can minimize error for single-curvature shapes. These results demonstrate the feasibility of distributed IMU-based shape sensing for vine robots while highlighting key limitations and opportunities for improved modeling and algorithmic integration for field deployment.

Abstract: Safety-critical task planning in robotic systems remains challenging: classical planners suffer from poor scalability, Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based methods generalize poorly, and base Large Language Models (LLMs) cannot guarantee safety. To address this gap, we propose safety-generalizable large language models, named SafeGen-LLM. SafeGen-LLM can not only enhance the safety satisfaction of task plans but also generalize well to novel safety properties in various domains. We first construct a multi-domain Planning Domain Definition Language 3 (PDDL3) benchmark with explicit safety constraints. Then, we introduce a two-stage post-training framework: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on a constraint-compliant planning dataset to learn planning syntax and semantics, and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) guided by fine-grained reward machines derived from formal verification to enforce safety alignment and by curriculum learning to better handle complex tasks. Extensive experiments show that SafeGen-LLM achieves strong safety generalization and outperforms frontier proprietary baselines across multi-domain planning tasks and multiple input formats (e.g., PDDLs and natural language).

Abstract: Detection of rare lesions in whole-body CT is fundamentally limited by extreme class imbalance and low target-to-volume ratios, producing precision collapse despite high AUROC. Synthetic augmentation with diffusion models offers promise, yet pixel-space diffusion is computationally expensive, and existing mask-conditioned approaches lack controllable attribute-level regulation and paired supervision for accountable training. We introduce SALIENT, a mask-conditioned wavelet-domain diffusion framework that synthesizes paired lesion-masking volumes for controllable CT augmentation under long-tail regimes. Instead of denoising in pixel space, SALIENT performs structured diffusion over discrete wavelet coefficients, explicitly separating low-frequency brightness from high-frequency structural detail. Learnable frequency-aware objectives disentangle target and background attributes (structure, contrast, edge fidelity), enabling interpretable and stable optimization. A 3D VAE generates diverse volumetric lesion masks, and a semi-supervised teacher produces paired slice-level pseudo-labels for downstream mask-guided detection. SALIENT improves generative realism, as reflected by higher MS-SSIM (0.63 to 0.83) and lower FID (118.4 to 46.5). In a separate downstream evaluation, SALIENT-augmented training improves long-tail detection performance, yielding disproportionate AUPRC gains across low prevalences and target-to-volume ratios. Optimal synthetic ratios shift from 2x to 4x as labeled seed size decreases, indicating a seed-dependent augmentation regime under low-label conditions. SALIENT demonstrates that frequency-aware diffusion enables controllable, computationally efficient precision rescue in long-tail CT detection.

Abstract: Spatially variant dynamic convolution provides a principled approach of integrating spatial adaptivity into deep neural networks. However, mainstream designs in medical segmentation commonly generate dynamic kernels through average pooling, which implicitly collapses high-frequency spatial details into a coarse, spatially-compressed representation, leading to over-smoothed predictions that degrade the fidelity of fine-grained clinical structures. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Structure-Guided Dynamic Convolution (SGDC) mechanism, which leverages an explicitly supervised structure-extraction branch to guide the generation of dynamic kernels and gating signals for structure-aware feature modulation. Specifically, the high-fidelity boundary information from this auxiliary branch is fused with semantic features to enable spatially-precise feature modulation. By replacing context aggregation with pixel-wise structural guidance, the proposed design effectively prevents the information loss introduced by average pooling. Experimental results show that SGDC achieves state-of-the-art performance on ISIC 2016, PH2, ISIC 2018, and CoNIC datasets, delivering superior boundary fidelity by reducing the Hausdorff Distance (HD95) by 2.05, and providing consistent IoU gains of 0.99\%-1.49\% over pooling-based baselines. Moreover, the mechanism exhibits strong potential for extension to other fine-grained, structure-sensitive vision tasks, such as small-object detection, offering a principled solution for preserving structural integrity in medical image analysis. To facilitate reproducibility and encourage further research, the implementation code for both our SGE and SGDC modules has been is publicly released at https://github.com/solstice0621/SGDC.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation models are typically optimised with voxel-wise losses that constrain predictions only in the output space. This leaves latent feature representations largely unconstrained, potentially limiting generalisation. We propose {SegReg}, a latent-space regularisation framework that operates on feature maps of U-Net models to encourage structured embeddings while remaining fully compatible with standard segmentation losses. Integrated with the nnU-Net framework, we evaluate SegReg on prostate, cardiac, and hippocampus segmentation and demonstrate consistent improvements in domain generalisation. Furthermore, we show that explicit latent regularisation improves continual learning by reducing task drift and enhancing forward transfer across sequential tasks without adding memory or any extra parameters. These results highlight latent-space regularisation as a practical approach for building more generalisable and continual-learning-ready models.

Abstract: Foundation models pretrained on large-scale 3D medical imaging data face challenges when adapted to multiple downstream tasks under continual learning with limited labeled data. We address few-shot continual learning for 3D brain MRI by combining a frozen pretrained backbone with task-specific Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules. Tasks arrive sequentially -- tumor segmentation (BraTS) and brain age estimation (IXI) -- with no replay of previous task data. Each task receives a dedicated LoRA adapter; only the adapter and task-specific head are trained while the backbone remains frozen, thereby eliminating catastrophic forgetting by design (BWT=0). In continual learning, sequential full fine-tuning suffers severe forgetting (T1 Dice drops from 0.80 to 0.16 after T2), while sequential linear probing achieves strong T1 (Dice 0.79) but fails on T2 (MAE 1.45). Our LoRA approach achieves the best balanced performance across both tasks: T1 Dice 0.62$\pm$0.07, T2 MAE 0.16$\pm$0.05, with zero forgetting and $<$0.1\% trainable parameters per task, though with noted systematic age underestimation in T2 (Wilcoxon $p<0.001$). Frozen foundation models with task-specific LoRA adapters thus offer a practical solution when both tasks must be maintained under few-shot continual learning.

Abstract: We propose a Hierarchical Multi-scale Knowledge-aware Graph Network (HMKGN) that models multi-scale interactions and spatially hierarchical relationships within whole-slide images (WSIs) for cancer prognostication. Unlike conventional attention-based MIL, which ignores spatial organization, or graph-based MIL, which relies on static handcrafted graphs, HMKGN enforces a hierarchical structure with spatial locality constraints, wherein local cellular-level dynamic graphs aggregate spatially proximate patches within each region of interest (ROI) and a global slide-level dynamic graph integrates ROI-level features into WSI-level representations. Moreover, multi-scale integration at the ROI level combines coarse contextual features from broader views with fine-grained structural representations from local patch-graph aggregation. We evaluate HMKGN on four TCGA cohorts (KIRC, LGG, PAAD, and STAD; N=513, 487, 138, and 370) for survival prediction. It consistently outperforms existing MIL-based models, yielding improved concordance indices (10.85% better) and statistically significant stratification of patient survival risk (log-rank p < 0.05).

Abstract: Despite the success of deep learning in dermoscopy image analysis, its inherent black-box nature hinders clinical trust, motivating the use of prototypical networks for case-based visual transparency. However, inevitable selection bias in clinical data often drives these models toward shortcut learning, where environmental confounders are erroneously encoded as predictive prototypes, generating spurious visual evidence that misleads medical decision-making. To mitigate these confounding effects, we propose CausalProto, an Unsupervised Causal Prototypical Network that fundamentally purifies the visual evidence chain. Framed within a Structural Causal Model, we employ an Information Bottleneck-constrained encoder to enforce strict unsupervised orthogonal disentanglement between pathological features and environmental confounders. By mapping these decoupled representations into independent prototypical spaces, we leverage the learned spurious dictionary to perform backdoor adjustment via do-calculus, transforming complex causal interventions into efficient expectation pooling to marginalize environmental noise. Extensive experiments on multiple dermoscopy datasets demonstrate that CausalProto achieves superior diagnostic performance and consistently outperforms standard black box models, while simultaneously providing transparent and high purity visual interpretability without suffering from the traditional accuracy compromise.

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) enables contact free monitoring of vital signs and is especially valuable for neonates, since conventional methods often require sustained skin contact with adhesive probes that can irritate fragile skin and increase infection control burden. We present VideoPulse, a neonatal dataset and an end to end pipeline that estimates neonatal heart rate and peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) from facial video. VideoPulse contains 157 recordings totaling 2.6 hours from 52 neonates with diverse face orientations. Our pipeline performs face alignment and artifact aware supervision using denoised pulse oximeter signals, then applies 3D CNN backbones for heart rate and SpO2 regression with label distribution smoothing and weighted regression for SpO2. Predictions are produced in 2 second windows. On the NBHR neonatal dataset, we obtain heart rate MAE 2.97 bpm using 2 second windows (2.80 bpm at 6 second windows) and SpO2 MAE 1.69 percent. Under cross dataset evaluation, the NBHR trained heart rate model attains 5.34 bpm MAE on VideoPulse, and fine tuning an NBHR pretrained SpO2 model on VideoPulse yields MAE 1.68 percent. These results indicate that short unaligned neonatal video segments can support accurate heart rate and SpO2 estimation, enabling low cost non invasive monitoring in neonatal intensive care.

Abstract: State-of-the-art vessel segmentation methods typically require large-scale annotated datasets and suffer from severe performance degradation under domain shifts. In clinical practice, however, acquiring extensive annotations for every new scanner or protocol is unfeasible. To address this, we propose a novel framework leveraging a pre-trained Vision Foundation Model (DINOv3) adapted for volumetric vessel segmentation. We introduce a lightweight 3D Adapter for volumetric consistency, a multi-scale 3D Aggregator for hierarchical feature fusion, and Z-channel embedding to effectively bridge the gap between 2D pre-training and 3D medical modalities, enabling the model to capture continuous vascular structures from limited data. We validated our method on the TopCoW (in-domain) and Lausanne (out-of-distribution) datasets. In the extreme few-shot regime with 5 training samples, our method achieved a Dice score of 43.42%, marking a 30% relative improvement over the state-of-the-art nnU-Net (33.41%) and outperforming other Transformer-based baselines, such as SwinUNETR and UNETR, by up to 45%. Furthermore, in the out-of-distribution setting, our model demonstrated superior robustness, achieving a 50% relative improvement over nnU-Net (21.37% vs. 14.22%), which suffered from severe domain overfitting. Ablation studies confirmed that our 3D adaptation mechanism and multi-scale aggregation strategy are critical for vascular continuity and robustness. Our results suggest foundation models offer a viable cold-start solution, improving clinical reliability under data scarcity or domain shifts.

Abstract: Accurate focus quality assessment (FQA) in fluorescence microscopy remains challenging, as the stain-dependent optical properties of fluorescent dyes cause abrupt and heterogeneous focus shifts. However, existing datasets and models overlook this variability, treating focus quality as a stain-agnostic problem. In this work, we formulate the task of stain-aware FQA, emphasizing that focus behavior in fluorescence microscopy must be modeled as a function of staining characteristics. Through quantitative analysis of existing datasets (FocusPath, BBBC006) and our newly curated FluoMix, we demonstrate that focus-rank relationships vary substantially across stains, underscoring the need for stain-aware modeling in fluorescence microscopy. To support this new formulation, we propose FluoMix, the first dataset for stain-aware FQA that encompasses multiple tissues, fluorescent stains, and focus variations. Building on this dataset, we propose FluoCLIP, a two-stage vision-language framework that leverages CLIP's alignment capability to interpret focus quality in the context of biological staining. In the stain-grounding phase, FluoCLIP learns general stain representations by aligning textual stain tokens with visual features, while in the stain-guided ranking phase, it optimizes stain-specific rank prompts for ordinal focus prediction. Together, our formulation, dataset, and framework establish the first foundation for stain-aware FQA, and FluoCLIP achieves strong generalization across diverse fluorescence microscopy conditions.

Abstract: Automated identification of DICOM image series is essential for large-scale medical image analysis, quality control, protocol harmonization, and reliable downstream processing. However, DICOM series classification remains challenging due to heterogeneous slice content, variable series length, and entirely missing, incomplete or inconsistent DICOM metadata. We propose an end-to-end multimodal framework for DICOM series classification that jointly models image content and acquisition metadata while explicitly accounting for all these challenges. (i) Images and metadata are encoded with modality-aware modules and fused using a bi-directional cross-modal attention mechanism. (ii) Metadata is processed by a sparse, missingness-aware encoder based on learnable feature dictionaries and value-conditioned modulation. By design, the approach does not require any form of imputation. (iii) Variability in series length and image data dimensions is handled via a 2.5D visual encoder and attention operating on equidistantly sampled slices. We evaluate the proposed approach on the publicly available Duke Liver MRI dataset and a large multi-institutional in-house cohort, assessing both in-domain performance and out-of-domain generalization. Across all evaluation settings, the proposed method consistently outperforms relevant image only, metadata-only and multimodal 2D/3D baselines. The results demonstrate that explicitly modeling metadata sparsity and cross-modal interactions improves robustness for DICOM series classification.

Abstract: Color polarization demosaicking (CPDM) aims to reconstruct full-resolution polarization images of four directions from the color-polarization filter array (CPFA) raw image. Due to the challenge of predicting numerous missing pixels and the scarcity of high-quality training data, existing network-based methods, despite effectively recovering scene intensity information, still exhibit significant errors in reconstructing polarization characteristics (degree of polarization, DOP, and angle of polarization, AOP). To address this problem, we introduce the image diffusion prior from text-to-image (T2I) models to overcome the performance bottleneck of network-based methods, with the additional diffusion prior compensating for limited representational capacity caused by restricted data distribution. To effectively leverage the diffusion prior, we explicitly model the polarization uncertainty during reconstruction and use uncertainty to guide the diffusion model in recovering high error regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method accurately recovers scene polarization characteristics with both high fidelity and strong visual perception.

Abstract: Rapid infarct assessment on non-contrast CT (NCCT) is essential for acute ischemic stroke management. Most deep learning methods perform pixel-wise segmentation without modeling the structured anatomical reasoning underlying ASPECTS scoring, where basal ganglia (BG) and supraganglionic (SG) levels are clinically interpreted in a coupled manner. We propose a clinically aligned framework that combines a frozen DINOv3 backbone with a lightweight decoder and introduce a Territory-Aware Gated Loss (TAGL) to enforce BG-SG consistency during training. This anatomically informed supervision adds no inference-time complexity. Our method achieves a Dice score of 0.6385 on AISD, outperforming prior CNN and foundation-model baselines. On a proprietary ASPECTS dataset, TAGL improves mean Dice from 0.698 to 0.767. These results demonstrate that integrating foundation representations with structured clinical priors improves NCCT stroke segmentation and ASPECTS delineation.

Abstract: Precise volumetric delineation of hippocampal structures is essential for quantifying neurodevelopmental trajectories in pre-term and term infants, where subtle morphological variations may carry prognostic significance. While foundation encoders trained on large-scale visual data offer discriminative representations, their 2D formulation is a limitation with respect to the $3$D organization of brain anatomy. We propose a volumetric segmentation strategy that reconciles this tension through a structured window-based disassembly-reassembly mechanism: the global MRI volume is decomposed into non-overlapping 3D windows or sub-cubes, each processed via a separate decoding arm built upon frozen high-fidelity features, and subsequently reassembled prior to a ground-truth correspendence using a dense-prediction head. This architecture preserves constant a decoder memory footprint while forcing predictions to lie within an anatomically consistent geometry. Evaluated on the ALBERT dataset for hippocampal segmentation, the proposed approach achieves a Dice score of 0.65 for a single 3D window. The method demonstrates that volumetric anatomical structure could be recovered from frozen 2D foundation representations through structured compositional decoding, and offers a principled and generalizable extension for foundation models for 3D medical applications.
