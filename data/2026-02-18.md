Abstract: Accurate polyp segmentation in colonoscopy is essential for cancer prevention but remains challenging due to: (1) high morphological variability (from flat to protruding lesions), (2) strong visual similarity to normal structures such as folds and vessels, and (3) the need for robust multi-scale detection. Existing deep learning approaches suffer from unidirectional processing, weak multi-scale fusion, and the absence of anatomical constraints, often leading to false positives (over-segmentation of normal structures) and false negatives (missed subtle flat lesions). We propose GRAFNet, a biologically inspired architecture that emulates the hierarchical organisation of the human visual system. GRAFNet integrates three key modules: (1) a Guided Asymmetric Attention Module (GAAM) that mimics orientation-tuned cortical neurones to emphasise polyp boundaries, (2) a MultiScale Retinal Module (MSRM) that replicates retinal ganglion cell pathways for parallel multi-feature analysis, and (3) a Guided Cortical Attention Feedback Module (GCAFM) that applies predictive coding for iterative refinement. These are unified in a Polyp Encoder-Decoder Module (PEDM) that enforces spatial-semantic consistency via resolution-adaptive feedback. Extensive experiments on five public benchmarks (Kvasir-SEG, CVC-300, CVC-ColonDB, CVC-Clinic, and PolypGen) demonstrate consistent state-of-the-art performance, with 3-8% Dice improvements and 10-20% higher generalisation over leading methods, while offering interpretable decision pathways. This work establishes a paradigm in which neural computation principles bridge the gap between AI accuracy and clinically trustworthy reasoning.

Abstract: Zero-shot Human-object interaction (HOI) detection aims to locate humans and objects in images and recognize their interactions. While advances in open-vocabulary object detection provide promising solutions for object localization, interaction recognition (IR) remains challenging due to the combinatorial diversity of interactions. Existing methods, including two-stage methods, tightly couple IR with a specific detector and rely on coarse-grained vision-language model (VLM) features, which limit generalization to unseen interactions. In this work, we propose a decoupled framework that separates object detection from IR and leverages multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) for zero-shot IR. We introduce a deterministic generation method that formulates IR as a visual question answering task and enforces deterministic outputs, enabling training-free zero-shot IR. To further enhance performance and efficiency by fine-tuning the model, we design a spatial-aware pooling module that integrates appearance and pairwise spatial cues, and a one-pass deterministic matching method that predicts all candidate interactions in a single forward pass. Extensive experiments on HICO-DET and V-COCO demonstrate that our method achieves superior zero-shot performance, strong cross-dataset generalization, and the flexibility to integrate with any object detectors without retraining. The codes are publicly available at https://github.com/SY-Xuan/DA-HOI.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: High-quality video datasets are foundational for training robust models in tasks like action recognition, phase detection, and event segmentation. However, many real-world video datasets suffer from annotation errors such as *mislabeling*, where segments are assigned incorrect class labels, and *disordering*, where the temporal sequence does not follow the correct progression. These errors are particularly harmful in phase-annotated tasks, where temporal consistency is critical. We propose a novel, model-agnostic method for detecting annotation errors by analyzing the Cumulative Sample Loss (CSL)--defined as the average loss a frame incurs when passing through model checkpoints saved across training epochs. This per-frame loss trajectory acts as a dynamic fingerprint of frame-level learnability. Mislabeled or disordered frames tend to show consistently high or irregular loss patterns, as they remain difficult for the model to learn throughout training, while correctly labeled frames typically converge to low loss early. To compute CSL, we train a video segmentation model and store its weights at each epoch. These checkpoints are then used to evaluate the loss of each frame in a test video. Frames with persistently high CSL are flagged as likely candidates for annotation errors, including mislabeling or temporal misalignment. Our method does not require ground truth on annotation errors and is generalizable across datasets. Experiments on EgoPER and Cholec80 demonstrate strong detection performance, effectively identifying subtle inconsistencies such as mislabeling and frame disordering. The proposed approach provides a powerful tool for dataset auditing and improving training reliability in video-based machine learning.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Super-resolution is widely used in medical imaging to enhance low-quality data, reducing scan time and improving abnormality detection. Conventional super-resolution approaches typically rely on paired datasets of downsampled and original high resolution images, training models to reconstruct high resolution images from their artificially degraded counterparts. However, in real-world clinical settings, low resolution data often arise from acquisition mechanisms that differ significantly from simple downsampling. As a result, these inputs may lie outside the domain of the training data, leading to poor model generalization due to domain shift. To address this limitation, we propose a distributional deep learning framework that improves model robustness and domain generalization. We develop this approch for enhancing the resolution of 4D Flow MRI (4DF). This is a novel imaging modality that captures hemodynamic flow velocity and clinically relevant metrics such as vessel wall stress. These metrics are critical for assessing aneurysm rupture risk. Our model is initially trained on high resolution computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and their downsampled counterparts. It is then fine-tuned on a small, harmonized dataset of paired 4D Flow MRI and CFD samples. We derive the theoretical properties of our distributional estimators and demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms traditional deep learning approaches through real data applications. This highlights the effectiveness of distributional learning in addressing domain shift and improving super-resolution performance in clinically realistic scenarios.

Abstract: Generative models have made it possible to synthesize highly realistic images, potentially providing an abundant data source for training machine learning models. Despite the advantages of these synthesizable data sources, the indiscriminate use of generated images as real images for training can even cause mode collapse due to modality discrepancies between real and synthetic domains. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for discriminative use of generated images, coined GMAIL, that explicitly treats generated images as a separate modality from real images. Instead of indiscriminately replacing real images with generated ones in the pixel space, our approach bridges the two distinct modalities in the same latent space through a multi-modal learning approach. To be specific, we first fine-tune a model exclusively on generated images using a cross-modality alignment loss and then employ this aligned model to further train various vision-language models with generated images. By aligning the two modalities, our approach effectively leverages the benefits of recent advances in generative models, thereby boosting the effectiveness of generated image learning across a range of vision-language tasks. Our framework can be easily incorporated with various vision-language models, and we demonstrate its efficacy throughout extensive experiments. For example, our framework significantly improves performance on image captioning, zero-shot image retrieval, zero-shot image classification, and long caption retrieval tasks. It also shows positive generated data scaling trends and notable enhancements in the captioning performance of the large multimodal model, LLaVA.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Camera virtualization -- an emerging solution to novel view synthesis -- holds transformative potential for visual entertainment, live performances, and sports broadcasting by enabling the generation of photorealistic images from novel viewpoints using images from a limited set of calibrated multiple static physical cameras. Despite recent advances, achieving spatially and temporally coherent and photorealistic rendering of dynamic scenes with efficient time-archival capabilities, particularly in fast-paced sports and stage performances, remains challenging for existing approaches. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for dynamic scenes could offer real-time view-synthesis results. Yet, they are hindered by their dependence on accurate 3D point clouds from the structure-from-motion method and their inability to handle large, non-rigid, rapid motions of different subjects (e.g., flips, jumps, articulations, sudden player-to-player transitions). Moreover, independent motions of multiple subjects can break the Gaussian-tracking assumptions commonly used in 4DGS, ST-GS, and other dynamic splatting variants. This paper advocates reconsidering a neural volume rendering formulation for camera virtualization and efficient time-archival capabilities, making it useful for sports broadcasting and related applications. By modeling a dynamic scene as rigid transformations across multiple synchronized camera views at a given time, our method performs neural representation learning, providing enhanced visual rendering quality at test time. A key contribution of our approach is its support for time-archival, i.e., users can revisit any past temporal instance of a dynamic scene and can perform novel view synthesis, enabling retrospective rendering for replay, analysis, and archival of live events, a functionality absent in existing neural rendering approaches and novel view synthesis...

Abstract: We present the first comprehensive, large-scale study of training long-context vision language models up to 344K context, targeting long-document visual question answering with measured transfer to long-context text. While several such strong are open-weight, namely Qwen3 VL and GLM 4.5/6V, their training recipes and data pipelines are not reproducible. We systematically study continued pretraining, supervised finetuning, and preference optimization for 24B and 32B parameter models, backed by extensive LC evaluations and ablations to bridge this gap, and achieve state-of-the-art performance on MMLongBenchDoc for both parameter scales. In addition to this, our key findings include: (i) training on context lengths that match evaluation context lengths outperforms training on longer contexts, (ii) training and evaluating with page indices provides a simple, high-impact boost to long-document performance, (iii) our synthetic data pipelines enable self-improvement via continued pretraining and supervised finetuning, and (iv) we extend the known text-to-visual long context transfer to the reverse, showing that visual long context training transfers to long-context text performance. We also release MMLBD-C, a manually corrected version of MMLongBenchDoc to reduce erroneous and low quality examples in the benchmark.

Abstract: Dataset distillation compresses the original data into compact synthetic datasets, reducing training time and storage while retaining model performance, enabling deployment under limited resources. Although recent decoupling-based distillation methods enable dataset distillation at large-scale, they continue to face an efficiency gap: optimization-based decoupling methods achieve higher accuracy but demand intensive computation, whereas optimization-free decoupling methods are efficient but sacrifice accuracy. To overcome this trade-off, we propose Exploration-Exploitation Distillation (E^2D), a simple, practical method that minimizes redundant computation through an efficient pipeline that begins with full-image initialization to preserve semantic integrity and feature diversity. It then uses a two-phase optimization strategy: an exploration phase that performs uniform updates and identifies high-loss regions, and an exploitation phase that focuses updates on these regions to accelerate convergence. We evaluate E^2D on large-scale benchmarks, surpassing the state-of-the-art on ImageNet-1K while being 18x faster, and on ImageNet-21K, our method substantially improves accuracy while remaining 4.3x faster. These results demonstrate that targeted, redundancy-reducing updates, rather than brute-force optimization, bridge the gap between accuracy and efficiency in large-scale dataset distillation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The web is littered with images, once created for human consumption and now increasingly interpreted by agents using vision-language models (VLMs). These agents make visual decisions at scale, deciding what to click, recommend, or buy. Yet, we know little about the structure of their visual preferences. We introduce a framework for studying this by placing VLMs in controlled image-based choice tasks and systematically perturbing their inputs. Our key idea is to treat the agent's decision function as a latent visual utility that can be inferred through revealed preference: choices between systematically edited images. Starting from common images, such as product photos, we propose methods for visual prompt optimization, adapting text optimization methods to iteratively propose and apply visually plausible modifications using an image generation model (such as in composition, lighting, or background). We then evaluate which edits increase selection probability. Through large-scale experiments on frontier VLMs, we demonstrate that optimized edits significantly shift choice probabilities in head-to-head comparisons. We develop an automatic interpretability pipeline to explain these preferences, identifying consistent visual themes that drive selection. We argue that this approach offers a practical and efficient way to surface visual vulnerabilities, safety concerns that might otherwise be discovered implicitly in the wild, supporting more proactive auditing and governance of image-based AI agents.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Text-to-video generation is expensive, so only a few samples are typically produced per prompt. In this low-sample regime, maximizing the value of each batch requires high cross-video diversity. Recent methods improve diversity for image generation, but for videos they often degrade within-video temporal consistency and require costly backpropagation through a video decoder. We propose a joint-sampling framework for flow-matching video generators that improves batch diversity while preserving temporal consistency. Our approach applies diversity-driven updates and then removes only the components that would decrease a temporal-consistency objective. To avoid image-space gradients, we compute both objectives with lightweight latent-space models, avoiding video decoding and decoder backpropagation. Experiments on a state-of-the-art text-to-video flow-matching model show diversity comparable to strong joint-sampling baselines while substantially improving temporal consistency and color naturalness. Code will be released.

Abstract: Zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) has gained increasing attention in medical imaging as a way to identify abnormalities without task-specific supervision, but most advances remain limited to 2D datasets. Extending ZSAD to 3D medical images has proven challenging, with existing methods relying on slice-wise features and vision-language models, which fail to capture volumetric structure. In this paper, we introduce a fully training-free framework for ZSAD in 3D brain MRI that constructs localized volumetric tokens by aggregating multi-axis slices processed by 2D foundation models. These 3D patch tokens restore cubic spatial context and integrate directly with distance-based, batch-level anomaly detection pipelines. The framework provides compact 3D representations that are practical to compute on standard GPUs and require no fine-tuning, prompts, or supervision. Our results show that training-free, batch-based ZSAD can be effectively extended from 2D encoders to full 3D MRI volumes, offering a simple and robust approach for volumetric anomaly detection.

Abstract: Although speculative decoding is widely used to accelerate Vision-Language Models (VLMs) inference, it faces severe performance collapse when applied to Video Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs). The draft model typically falls into the trap of attention dilution and negative visual gain due to key-value cache explosion and context window mismatches. We observe a visual semantic internalization phenomenon in Vid-LLMs, indicating that critical visual semantics are implicitly encoded into text hidden states during deep-layer interactions, which renders raw visual inputs structurally redundant during deep inference. To address this, we propose the Sparrow framework, which first utilizes visually-aware text-anchored window attention via hidden state reuse to fully offload visual computation to the target model, and leverages intermediate-layer visual state bridging to train the draft model with semantic-rich intermediate states, thereby filtering out low-level visual noise. Additionally, a multi-token prediction strategy is introduced to bridge the training-inference distribution shift. Experiments show that Sparrow achieves an average speedup of 2.82x even with 25k visual tokens, effectively resolving the performance degradation in long sequences and offering a practical solution for real-time long video tasks.

Abstract: Online video understanding requires models to perform continuous perception and long-range reasoning within potentially infinite visual streams. Its fundamental challenge lies in the conflict between the unbounded nature of streaming media input and the limited context window of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Current methods primarily rely on passive processing, which often face a trade-off between maintaining long-range context and capturing the fine-grained details necessary for complex tasks. To address this, we introduce EventMemAgent, an active online video agent framework based on a hierarchical memory module. Our framework employs a dual-layer strategy for online videos: short-term memory detects event boundaries and utilizes event-granular reservoir sampling to process streaming video frames within a fixed-length buffer dynamically; long-term memory structuredly archives past observations on an event-by-event basis. Furthermore, we integrate a multi-granular perception toolkit for active, iterative evidence capture and employ Agentic Reinforcement Learning (Agentic RL) to end-to-end internalize reasoning and tool-use strategies into the agent's intrinsic capabilities. Experiments show that EventMemAgent achieves competitive results on online video benchmarks. The code will be released here: https://github.com/lingcco/EventMemAgent.

Abstract: Multimodal Fusion Learning (MFL), leveraging disparate data from various imaging modalities (e.g., MRI, CT, SPECT), has shown great potential for addressing medical problems such as skin cancer and brain tumor prediction. However, existing MFL methods face three key limitations: a) they often specialize in specific modalities, and overlook effective shared complementary information across diverse modalities, hence limiting their generalizability for multi-disease analysis; b) they rely on computationally expensive models, restricting their applicability in resource-limited settings; and c) they lack robustness against adversarial attacks, compromising reliability in medical AI applications. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Multi-Attention Integration Learning (MAIL) network, incorporating two key components: a) an efficient residual learning attention block for capturing refined modality-specific multi-scale patterns and b) an efficient multimodal cross-attention module for learning enriched complementary shared representations across diverse modalities. Furthermore, to ensure adversarial robustness, we extend MAIL network to design Robust-MAIL by incorporating random projection filters and modulated attention noise. Extensive evaluations on 20 public datasets show that both MAIL and Robust-MAIL outperform existing methods, achieving performance gains of up to 9.34% while reducing computational costs by up to 78.3%. These results highlight the superiority of our approaches, ensuring more reliable predictions than top competitors. Code: https://github.com/misti1203/MAIL-Robust-MAIL.

Abstract: Dog emotion recognition plays a crucial role in enhancing human-animal interactions, veterinary care, and the development of automated systems for monitoring canine well-being. However, accurately interpreting dog emotions is challenging due to the subjective nature of emotional assessments and the absence of standardized ground truth methods. We present the CREMD (Crowd-sourced Emotional Multimodal Dogs Dataset), a comprehensive dataset exploring how different presentation modes (e.g., context, audio, video) and annotator characteristics (e.g., dog ownership, gender, professional experience) influence the perception and labeling of dog emotions. The dataset consists of 923 video clips presented in three distinct modes: without context or audio, with context but no audio, and with both context and audio. We analyze annotations from diverse participants, including dog owners, professionals, and individuals with varying demographic backgrounds and experience levels, to identify factors that influence reliable dog emotion recognition. Our findings reveal several key insights: (1) while adding visual context significantly improved annotation agreement, our findings regarding audio cues are inconclusive due to design limitations (specifically, the absence of a no-context-with-audio condition and limited clean audio availability); (2) contrary to expectations, non-owners and male annotators showed higher agreement levels than dog owners and female annotators, respectively, while professionals showed higher agreement levels, aligned with our initial hypothesis; and (3) the presence of audio substantially increased annotators' confidence in identifying specific emotions, particularly anger and fear.

Abstract: The emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting has fundamentally redefined the capabilities of photorealistic neural rendering by enabling high-throughput synthesis of complex environments. While procedural methods like Wang Tiles have recently been integrated to facilitate the generation of expansive landscapes, these systems typically remain constrained by a reliance on densely sampled exemplar reconstructions. We present DAV-GSWT, a data-efficient framework that leverages diffusion priors and active view sampling to synthesize high-fidelity Gaussian Splatting Wang Tiles from minimal input observations. By integrating a hierarchical uncertainty quantification mechanism with generative diffusion models, our approach autonomously identifies the most informative viewpoints while hallucinating missing structural details to ensure seamless tile transitions. Experimental results indicate that our system significantly reduces the required data volume while maintaining the visual integrity and interactive performance necessary for large-scale virtual environments.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Day-to-night unpaired image translation is important to downstream tasks but remains challenging due to large appearance shifts and the lack of direct pixel-level supervision. Existing methods often introduce semantic hallucinations, where objects from target classes such as traffic signs and vehicles, as well as man-made light effects, are incorrectly synthesized. These hallucinations significantly degrade downstream performance. We propose a novel framework that detects and suppresses hallucinations of target-class features during unpaired translation. To detect hallucination, we design a dual-head discriminator that additionally performs semantic segmentation to identify hallucinated content in background regions. To suppress these hallucinations, we introduce class-specific prototypes, constructed by aggregating features of annotated target-domain objects, which act as semantic anchors for each class. Built upon a Schrodinger Bridge-based translation model, our framework performs iterative refinement, where detected hallucination features are explicitly pushed away from class prototypes in feature space, thus preserving object semantics across the translation trajectory.Experiments show that our method outperforms existing approaches both qualitatively and quantitatively. On the BDD100K dataset, it improves mAP by 15.5% for day-to-night domain adaptation, with a notable 31.7% gain for classes such as traffic lights that are prone to hallucinations.

Abstract: Diffusion models often yield highly curved trajectories and noisy score targets due to an uninformative, memoryless forward process that induces independent data-noise coupling. We propose Adjoint Schrödinger Bridge Matching (ASBM), a generative modeling framework that recovers optimal trajectories in high dimensions via two stages. First, we view the Schrödinger Bridge (SB) forward dynamic as a coupling construction problem and learn it through a data-to-energy sampling perspective that transports data to an energy-defined prior. Then, we learn the backward generative dynamic with a simple matching loss supervised by the induced optimal coupling. By operating in a non-memoryless regime, ASBM produces significantly straighter and more efficient sampling paths. Compared to prior works, ASBM scales to high-dimensional data with notably improved stability and efficiency. Extensive experiments on image generation show that ASBM improves fidelity with fewer sampling steps. We further showcase the effectiveness of our optimal trajectory via distillation to a one-step generator.

Abstract: Face morphing attacks threaten biometric verification, yet most morphing attack detection (MAD) systems require task-specific training and generalize poorly to unseen attack types. Meanwhile, open-source multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong visual-linguistic reasoning, but their potential in biometric forensics remains underexplored. In this paper, we present the first systematic zero-shot evaluation of open-source MLLMs for single-image MAD, using publicly available weights and a standardized, reproducible protocol. Across diverse morphing techniques, many MLLMs show non-trivial discriminative ability without any fine-tuning or domain adaptation, and LLaVA1.6-Mistral-7B achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing highly competitive task-specific MAD baselines by at least 23% in terms of equal error rate (EER). The results indicate that multimodal pretraining can implicitly encode fine-grained facial inconsistencies indicative of morphing artifacts, enabling zero-shot forensic sensitivity. Our findings position open-source MLLMs as reproducible, interpretable, and competitive foundations for biometric security and forensic image analysis. This emergent capability also highlights new opportunities to develop state-of-the-art MAD systems through targeted fine-tuning or lightweight adaptation, further improving accuracy and efficiency while preserving interpretability. To support future research, all code and evaluation protocols will be released upon publication.

Abstract: General-purpose super-resolution models, particularly Vision Transformers, have achieved remarkable success but exhibit fundamental inefficiencies in common infrared imaging scenarios like surveillance and autonomous driving, which operate from fixed or nearly-static viewpoints. These models fail to exploit the strong, persistent spatial priors inherent in such scenes, leading to redundant learning and suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose the Regional Prior attention Transformer for infrared image Super-Resolution (RPT-SR), a novel architecture that explicitly encodes scene layout information into the attention mechanism. Our core contribution is a dual-token framework that fuses (1) learnable, regional prior tokens, which act as a persistent memory for the scene's global structure, with (2) local tokens that capture the frame-specific content of the current input. By utilizing these tokens into an attention, our model allows the priors to dynamically modulate the local reconstruction process. Extensive experiments validate our approach. While most prior works focus on a single infrared band, we demonstrate the broad applicability and versatility of RPT-SR by establishing new state-of-the-art performance across diverse datasets covering both Long-Wave (LWIR) and Short-Wave (SWIR) spectra

Abstract: Minutiae extraction, a fundamental stage in fingerprint recognition, is increasingly shifting toward deep learning. However, truly end-to-end methods that eliminate separate preprocessing and postprocessing steps remain scarce. This paper introduces LEADER (Lightweight End-to-end Attention-gated Dual autoencodER), a neural network that maps raw fingerprint images to minutiae descriptors, including location, direction, and type. The proposed architecture integrates non-maximum suppression and angular decoding to enable complete end-to-end inference using only 0.9M parameters. It employs a novel "Castle-Moat-Rampart" ground-truth encoding and a dual-autoencoder structure, interconnected through an attention-gating mechanism. Experimental evaluations demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy on plain fingerprints and robust cross-domain generalization to latent impressions. Specifically, LEADER attains a 34% higher F1-score on the NIST SD27 dataset compared to specialized latent minutiae extractors. Sample-level analysis on this challenging benchmark reveals an average rank of 2.07 among all compared methods, with LEADER securing the first-place position in 47% of the samples-more than doubling the frequency of the second-best extractor. The internal representations learned by the model align with established fingerprint domain features, such as segmentation masks, orientation fields, frequency maps, and skeletons. Inference requires 15ms on GPU and 322ms on CPU, outperforming leading commercial software in computational efficiency. The source code and pre-trained weights are publicly released to facilitate reproducibility.

Abstract: Transient objects in casual multi-view captures cause ghosting artifacts in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) reconstruction. Existing solutions relied on scene decomposition at significant memory cost or on motion-based heuristics that were vulnerable to parallax ambiguity. A semantic filtering framework was proposed for category-aware transient removal using vision-language models. CLIP similarity scores between rendered views and distractor text prompts were accumulated per-Gaussian across training iterations. Gaussians exceeding a calibrated threshold underwent opacity regularization and periodic pruning. Unlike motion-based approaches, semantic classification resolved parallax ambiguity by identifying object categories independently of motion patterns. Experiments on the RobustNeRF benchmark demonstrated consistent improvement in reconstruction quality over vanilla 3DGS across four sequences, while maintaining minimal memory overhead and real-time rendering performance. Threshold calibration and comparisons with baselines validated semantic guidance as a practical strategy for transient removal in scenarios with predictable distractor categories.

Abstract: Quantifying biometric characteristics within hand gestures involve derivation of fitness scores from a gesture and identity aware feature space. However, evaluating the quality of these scores remains an open question. Existing biometric capacity estimation literature relies upon error rates. But these rates do not indicate goodness of scores. Thus, in this manuscript we present an exhaustive set of evaluation measures. We firstly identify ranking order and relevance of output scores as the primary basis for evaluation. In particular, we consider both rank deviation as well as rewards for: (i) higher scores of high ranked gestures and (ii) lower scores of low ranked gestures. We also compensate for correspondence between trends of output and ground truth scores. Finally, we account for disentanglement between identity features of gestures as a discounting factor. Integrating these elements with adequate weighting, we formulate advanced acceptance score as a holistic evaluation measure. To assess effectivity of the proposed we perform in-depth experimentation over three datasets with five state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Results show that the optimal score selected with our measure is more appropriate than existing other measures. Also, our proposed measure depicts correlation with existing measures. This further validates its reliability. We have made our \href{https://github.com/AmanVerma2307/MeasureSuite}{code} public.

Abstract: Recent studies have explored the combination of multiple LoRAs to simultaneously generate user-specified subjects and styles. However, most existing approaches fuse LoRA weights using static statistical heuristics that deviate from LoRA's original purpose of learning adaptive feature adjustments and ignore the randomness of sampled inputs. To address this, we propose a dynamic training-free fusion framework that operates throughout the generation process. During the forward pass, at each LoRA-applied layer, we dynamically compute the KL divergence between the base model's original features and those produced by subject and style LoRAs, respectively, and adaptively select the most appropriate weights for fusion. In the reverse denoising stage, we further refine the generation trajectory by dynamically applying gradient-based corrections derived from objective metrics such as CLIP and DINO scores, providing continuous semantic and stylistic guidance. By integrating these two complementary mechanisms-feature-level selection and metric-guided latent adjustment-across the entire diffusion timeline, our method dynamically achieves coherent subject-style synthesis without any retraining. Extensive experiments across diverse subject-style combinations demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art LoRA fusion methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Abstract: LVLMs have achieved strong multimodal reasoning capabilities but remain prone to hallucinations, producing outputs inconsistent with visual inputs or user instructions. Existing training-free methods, including contrastive decoding and auxiliary expert models, which incur several times more computational overhead and may introduce potential interference, as well as static internal signal enhancement, are often vulnerable to the attention sink phenomenon. We find that internal Positive Attention Dynamics (PAD) in LVLMs naturally reveal semantically core visual regions under the distortions of attention sinks. Based on this, we propose Positive Attention Dynamics Enhancement (PADE), a training-free attention intervention that constructs a PAD map to identify semantically core visual regions, applies per-head Median Absolute Deviation Scaling to adaptively control the intervention strength, and leverages System-Token Compensation to maintain attention to complex user instructions and support long-term output consistency. Experiments on multiple LVLMs and benchmarks show that PADE improves visual grounding and reduces hallucinations, validating the effectiveness of leveraging internal attention dynamics for reliable multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Intracoronary Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) enables high-resolution visualization of coronary vessel anatomy but presents challenges due to noise, imaging artifacts, and complex tissue structures. This paper proposes a fully automated pipeline for vessel segmentation and classification in OCT images using machine learning techniques. The proposed method integrates image preprocessing, guidewire artifact removal, polar-to-Cartesian transformation, unsupervised K-means clustering, and local feature extraction. These features are used to train Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine classifiers for pixel-wise vessel classification. Experimental results demonstrate excellent performance, achieving precision, recall, and F1-score values up to 1.00 and overall classification accuracy of 99.68%. The proposed approach provides accurate vessel boundary detection while maintaining low computational complexity and requiring minimal manual annotation. This method offers a reliable and efficient solution for automated OCT image analysis and has potential applications in clinical decision support and real-time medical image processing.

Abstract: Aligning functional schematics with 2D and 3D scene acquisitions is crucial for building digital twins, especially for old industrial facilities that lack native digital models. Current manual alignment using images and LiDAR data does not scale due to tediousness and complexity of industrial sites. Inconsistencies between schematics and reality, and the scarcity of public industrial datasets, make the problem both challenging and underexplored. This paper introduces IRIS-v2, a comprehensive dataset to support further research. It includes images, point clouds, 2D annotated boxes and segmentation masks, a CAD model, 3D pipe routing information, and the P&ID (Piping and Instrumentation Diagram). The alignment is experimented on a practical case study, aiming at reducing the time required for this task by combining segmentation and graph matching.

Abstract: This paper introduces RaCo, a lightweight neural network designed to learn robust and versatile keypoints suitable for a variety of 3D computer vision tasks. The model integrates three key components: the repeatable keypoint detector, a differentiable ranker to maximize matches with a limited number of keypoints, and a covariance estimator to quantify spatial uncertainty in metric scale. Trained on perspective image crops only, RaCo operates without the need for covisible image pairs. It achieves strong rotational robustness through extensive data augmentation, even without the use of computationally expensive equivariant network architectures. The method is evaluated on several challenging datasets, where it demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in keypoint repeatability and two-view matching, particularly under large in-plane rotations. Ultimately, RaCo provides an effective and simple strategy to independently estimate keypoint ranking and metric covariance without additional labels, detecting interpretable and repeatable interest points. The code is available at https://github.com/cvg/RaCo.

Abstract: Radiology Report Generation (RRG) through Vision-Language Models (VLMs) promises to reduce documentation burden, improve reporting consistency, and accelerate clinical workflows. However, their clinical adoption remains limited by the lack of interpretability and the tendency to hallucinate findings misaligned with imaging evidence. Existing research typically treats interpretability and accuracy as separate objectives, with concept-based explainability techniques focusing primarily on transparency, while Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods targeting factual grounding through external retrieval. We present Concept-Enhanced Multimodal RAG (CEMRAG), a unified framework that decomposes visual representations into interpretable clinical concepts and integrates them with multimodal RAG. This approach exploits enriched contextual prompts for RRG, improving both interpretability and factual accuracy. Experiments on MIMIC-CXR and IU X-Ray across multiple VLM architectures, training regimes, and retrieval configurations demonstrate consistent improvements over both conventional RAG and concept-only baselines on clinical accuracy metrics and standard NLP measures. These results challenge the assumed trade-off between interpretability and performance, showing that transparent visual concepts can enhance rather than compromise diagnostic accuracy in medical VLMs. Our modular design decomposes interpretability into visual transparency and structured language model conditioning, providing a principled pathway toward clinically trustworthy AI-assisted radiology.

Abstract: The strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa), known worldwide for its economic value and nutritional richness, is a widely cultivated fruit. Determining the correct ripeness level during the harvest period is crucial for both preventing losses for producers and ensuring consumers receive a quality product. However, traditional methods, i.e., visual assessments alone, can be subjective and have a high margin of error. Therefore, computer-assisted systems are needed. However, the scarcity of comprehensive datasets accessible to everyone in the literature makes it difficult to compare studies in this field. In this study, a new and publicly available strawberry ripeness dataset, consisting of 566 images and 1,201 labeled objects, prepared under variable light and environmental conditions in two different greenhouses in Turkey, is presented to the literature. Comparative tests conducted on the data set using YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and YOLO11-based models showed that the highest precision value was 90.94% in the YOLOv9c model, while the highest recall value was 83.74% in the YOLO11s model. In terms of the general performance criterion mAP@50, YOLOv8s was the best performing model with a success rate of 86.09%. The results show that small and medium-sized models work more balanced and efficiently on this type of dataset, while also establishing a fundamental reference point for smart agriculture applications.

Abstract: Deep learning-based segmentation and classification are crucial to large-scale biomedical imaging, particularly for 3D data, where manual analysis is impractical. Although many methods exist, selecting suitable models and tuning parameters remains a major bottleneck in practice. Hence, we introduce the 3D data Analysis Optimization Pipeline, a method designed to facilitate the design and parameterization of segmentation and classification using two Bayesian Optimization stages. First, the pipeline selects a segmentation model and optimizes postprocessing parameters using a domain-adapted syntactic benchmark dataset. To ensure a concise evaluation of segmentation performance, we introduce a segmentation quality metric that serves as the objective function. Second, the pipeline optimizes design choices of a classifier, such as encoder and classifier head architectures, incorporation of prior knowledge, and pretraining strategies. To reduce manual annotation effort, this stage includes an assisted class-annotation workflow that extracts predicted instances from the segmentation results and sequentially presents them to the operator, eliminating the need for manual tracking. In four case studies, the 3D data Analysis Optimization Pipeline efficiently identifies effective model and parameter configurations for individual datasets.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Across the natural and life sciences, images have become a primary measurement modality, yet the dominant analytic paradigm remains semantics-first. Structure is recovered by predicting or enforcing domain-specific labels. This paradigm fails systematically under the conditions that make image-based science most valuable, including open-ended scientific discovery, cross-sensor and cross-site comparability, and long-term monitoring in which domain ontologies and associated label sets drift culturally, institutionally, and ecologically. A deductive inversion is proposed in the form of criteria-first and semantics-later. A unified framework for criteria-first structure discovery is introduced. It separates criterion-defined, semantics-free structure extraction from downstream semantic mapping into domain ontologies or vocabularies and provides a domain-general scaffold for reproducible analysis across image-based sciences. Reproducible science requires that the first analytic layer perform criterion-driven, semantics-free structure discovery, yielding stable partitions, structural fields, or hierarchies defined by explicit optimality criteria rather than local domain ontologies. Semantics is not discarded; it is relocated downstream as an explicit mapping from the discovered structural product to a domain ontology or vocabulary, enabling plural interpretations and explicit crosswalks without rewriting upstream extraction. Grounded in cybernetics, observation-as-distinction, and information theory's separation of information from meaning, the argument is supported by cross-domain evidence showing that criteria-first components recur whenever labels do not scale. Finally, consequences are outlined for validation beyond class accuracy and for treating structural products as FAIR, AI-ready digital objects for long-term monitoring and digital twins.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved remarkable success across various vision tasks, yet their deployment is often hindered by prohibitive computational costs. While structured weight pruning and token compression have emerged as promising solutions, they suffer from prolonged retraining times and global propagation that creates optimization challenges, respectively. We propose ToaSt, a decoupled framework applying specialized strategies to distinct ViT components. We apply coupled head-wise structured pruning to Multi-Head Self-Attention modules, leveraging attention operation characteristics to enhance robustness. For Feed-Forward Networks (over 60\% of FLOPs), we introduce Token Channel Selection (TCS) that enhances compression ratios while avoiding global propagation issues. Our analysis reveals TCS effectively filters redundant noise during selection. Extensive evaluations across nine diverse models, including DeiT, ViT-MAE, and Swin Transformer, demonstrate that ToaSt achieves superior trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency, consistently outperforming existing baselines. On ViT-MAE-Huge, ToaSt achieves 88.52\% accuracy (+1.64 \%) with 39.4\% FLOPs reduction. ToaSt transfers effectively to downstream tasks, cccccachieving 52.2 versus 51.9 mAP on COCO object detection. Code and models will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires an agent to follow natural-language instructions and navigate through previously unseen environments. Recent approaches increasingly employ large language models (LLMs) as high-level navigators due to their flexibility and reasoning capability. However, prompt-based LLM navigation often suffers from inefficient decision-making, as the model must repeatedly interpret instructions from scratch and reason over noisy and verbose navigable candidates at each step. In this paper, we propose a retrieval-augmented framework to improve the efficiency and stability of LLM-based VLN without modifying or fine-tuning the underlying language model. Our approach introduces retrieval at two complementary levels. At the episode level, an instruction-level embedding retriever selects semantically similar successful navigation trajectories as in-context exemplars, providing task-specific priors for instruction grounding. At the step level, an imitation-learned candidate retriever prunes irrelevant navigable directions before LLM inference, reducing action ambiguity and prompt complexity. Both retrieval modules are lightweight, modular, and trained independently of the LLM. We evaluate our method on the Room-to-Room (R2R) benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate consistent improvements in Success Rate, Oracle Success Rate, and SPL on both seen and unseen environments. Ablation studies further show that instruction-level exemplar retrieval and candidate pruning contribute complementary benefits to global guidance and step-wise decision efficiency. These results indicate that retrieval-augmented decision support is an effective and scalable strategy for enhancing LLM-based vision-and-language navigation.

Abstract: Existing 3D open-vocabulary scene understanding methods mostly emphasize distilling language features from 2D foundation models into 3D feature fields, but largely overlook the synergy among scene appearance, semantics, and geometry. As a result, scene understanding often deviates from the underlying geometric structure of scenes and becomes decoupled from the reconstruction process. In this work, we propose a novel approach that leverages language and geometry grounded sparse voxel representations to comprehensively model appearance, semantics, and geometry within a unified framework. Specifically, we use 3D sparse voxels as primitives and employ an appearance field, a density field, a feature field, and a confidence field to holistically represent a 3D scene. To promote synergy among the appearance, density, and feature fields, we construct a feature modulation module and distill language features from a 2D foundation model into our 3D scene model. In addition, we integrate geometric distillation into feature field distillation to transfer geometric knowledge from a geometry foundation model to our 3D scene representations via depth correlation regularization and pattern consistency regularization. These components work together to synergistically model the appearance, semantics, and geometry of the 3D scene within a unified framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior overall performance compared with state-of-the-art methods in holistic scene understanding and reconstruction.

Abstract: Current research in multimodal models faces a key challenge where enhancing generative capabilities often comes at the expense of understanding, and vice versa. We analyzed this trade-off and identify the primary cause might be the potential conflict between generation and understanding, which creates a competitive dynamic within the model. To address this, we propose the Reason-Reflect-Refine (R3) framework. This innovative algorithm re-frames the single-step generation task into a multi-step process of "generate-understand-regenerate". By explicitly leveraging the model's understanding capability during generation, we successfully mitigate the optimization dilemma, achieved stronger generation results and improved understanding ability which are related to the generation process. This offers valuable insights for designing next-generation unified multimodal models. Code is available at https://github.com/sen-ye/R3.

Abstract: Endoscopy is essential in medical imaging, used for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. Developing a robust dynamic 3D reconstruction pipeline for endoscopic videos could enhance visualization, improve diagnostic accuracy, aid in treatment planning, and guide surgery procedures. However, challenges arise due to the deformable nature of the tissues, the use of monocular cameras, illumination changes, occlusions and unknown camera trajectories. Inspired by neural rendering, we introduce NeRFscopy, a self-supervised pipeline for novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction of deformable endoscopic tissues from a monocular video. NeRFscopy includes a deformable model with a canonical radiance field and a time-dependent deformation field parameterized by SE(3) transformations. In addition, the color images are efficiently exploited by introducing sophisticated terms to learn a 3D implicit model without assuming any template or pre-trained model, solely from data. NeRFscopy achieves accurate results in terms of novel view synthesis, outperforming competing methods across various challenging endoscopy scenes.

Abstract: Due to the rise in the use of renewable energies as an alternative to traditional ones, and especially solar energy, there is increasing interest in studying how to address photovoltaic forecasting in the face of the challenge of variability in photovoltaic energy production, using different methodologies. This work develops a hybrid approach for short and long-term forecasting based on two studies with the same purpose. A multimodal approach that combines images of the sky and photovoltaic energy history with meteorological data is proposed. The main goal is to improve the accuracy of ramp event prediction, increase the robustness of forecasts in cloudy conditions, and extend capabilities beyond nowcasting, to support more efficient operation of the power grid and better management of solar variability. Deep neural models are used for both nowcasting and forecasting solutions, incorporating individual and multiple meteorological variables, as well as an analytical solar position. The results demonstrate that the inclusion of meteorological data, particularly the surface long-wave, radiation downwards, and the combination of wind and solar position, significantly improves current predictions in both nowcasting and forecasting tasks, especially on cloudy days. This study highlights the importance of integrating diverse data sources to improve the reliability and interpretability of solar energy prediction models.

Abstract: Whole-slide images (WSIs) from cancer patients contain rich information that can be used for medical diagnosis or to follow treatment progress. To automate their analysis, numerous deep learning methods based on convolutional neural networks and Vision Transformers have been developed and have achieved strong performance in segmentation and classification tasks. However, due to the large size and complex cellular organization of WSIs, these models rely on patch-based representations, losing vital tissue-level context. We propose using scalable Graph Transformers on a full-WSI cell graph for classification. We evaluate this methodology on a challenging task: the classification of healthy versus tumor epithelial cells in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), where both cell types exhibit very similar morphologies and are therefore difficult to differentiate for image-based approaches. We first compared image-based and graph-based methods on a single WSI. Graph Transformer models SGFormer and DIFFormer achieved balanced accuracies of $85.2 \pm 1.5$ ($\pm$ standard error) and $85.1 \pm 2.5$ in 3-fold cross-validation, respectively, whereas the best image-based method reached $81.2 \pm 3.0$. By evaluating several node feature configurations, we found that the most informative representation combined morphological and texture features as well as the cell classes of non-epithelial cells, highlighting the importance of the surrounding cellular context. We then extended our work to train on several WSIs from several patients. To address the computational constraints of image-based models, we extracted four $2560 \times 2560$ pixel patches from each image and converted them into graphs. In this setting, DIFFormer achieved a balanced accuracy of $83.6 \pm 1.9$ (3-fold cross-validation), while the state-of-the-art image-based model CellViT256 reached $78.1 \pm 0.5$.

Abstract: Clinical deployment of chest radiograph classifiers requires models that can be updated as new datasets become available without retraining on previously ob- served data or degrading validated performance. We study, for the first time, a task-incremental continual learning setting for chest radiograph classification, in which heterogeneous chest X-ray datasets arrive sequentially and task identifiers are unavailable at inference. We propose a continual adapter-based routing learning strategy for Chest X-rays (CARL-XRay) that maintains a fixed high-capacity backbone and incrementally allocates lightweight task-specific adapters and classifier heads. A latent task selector operates on task-adapted features and leverages both current and historical context preserved through compact prototypes and feature-level experience replay. This design supports stable task identification and adaptation across sequential updates while avoiding raw-image storage. Experiments on large-scale public chest radiograph datasets demonstrate robust performance retention and reliable task-aware inference under continual dataset ingestion. CARL-XRay outperforms joint training under task-unknown deployment, achieving higher routing accuracy (75.0\% vs.\ 62.5\%), while maintaining competitive diagnostic performance with AUROC of 0.74 in the oracle setting with ground-truth task identity and 0.75 under task-unknown inference, using significantly fewer trainable parameters. Finally, the proposed framework provides a practical alternative to joint training and repeated full retraining in continual clinical deployment.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Sketching is inherently a sequential process, in which strokes are drawn in a meaningful order to explore and refine ideas. However, most generative models treat sketches as static images, overlooking the temporal structure that underlies creative drawing. We present a data-efficient approach for sequential sketch generation that adapts pretrained text-to-video diffusion models to generate sketching processes. Our key insight is that large language models and video diffusion models offer complementary strengths for this task: LLMs provide semantic planning and stroke ordering, while video diffusion models serve as strong renderers that produce high-quality, temporally coherent visuals. We leverage this by representing sketches as short videos in which strokes are progressively drawn on a blank canvas, guided by text-specified ordering instructions. We introduce a two-stage fine-tuning strategy that decouples the learning of stroke ordering from the learning of sketch appearance. Stroke ordering is learned using synthetic shape compositions with controlled temporal structure, while visual appearance is distilled from as few as seven manually authored sketching processes that capture both global drawing order and the continuous formation of individual strokes. Despite the extremely limited amount of human-drawn sketch data, our method generates high-quality sequential sketches that closely follow text-specified orderings while exhibiting rich visual detail. We further demonstrate the flexibility of our approach through extensions such as brush style conditioning and autoregressive sketch generation, enabling additional controllability and interactive, collaborative drawing.

Abstract: Long-horizon whole-body humanoid teleoperation remains challenging due to accumulated global pose drift, particularly on full-sized humanoids. Although recent learning-based tracking methods enable agile and coordinated motions, they typically operate in the robot's local frame and neglect global pose feedback, leading to drift and instability during extended execution. In this work, we present CLOT, a real-time whole-body humanoid teleoperation system that achieves closed-loop global motion tracking via high-frequency localization feedback. CLOT synchronizes operator and robot poses in a closed loop, enabling drift-free human-to-humanoid mimicry over long timehorizons. However, directly imposing global tracking rewards in reinforcement learning, often results in aggressive and brittle corrections. To address this, we propose a data-driven randomization strategy that decouples observation trajectories from reward evaluation, enabling smooth and stable global corrections. We further regularize the policy with an adversarial motion prior to suppress unnatural behaviors. To support CLOT, we collect 20 hours of carefully curated human motion data for training the humanoid teleoperation policy. We design a transformer-based policy and train it for over 1300 GPU hours. The policy is deployed on a full-sized humanoid with 31 DoF (excluding hands). Both simulation and real-world experiments verify high-dynamic motion, high-precision tracking, and strong robustness in sim-to-real humanoid teleoperation. Motion data, demos and code can be found in our website.

Abstract: The emergence of Self-Driving Laboratories (SDLs) transforms scientific discovery methodology by integrating AI with robotic automation to create closed-loop experimental systems capable of autonomous hypothesis generation, experimentation, and analysis. While promising to compress research timelines from years to weeks, their deployment introduces unprecedented safety challenges differing from traditional laboratories or purely digital AI. This paper presents Safe-SDL, a comprehensive framework for establishing robust safety boundaries and control mechanisms in AI-driven autonomous laboratories. We identify and analyze the critical ``Syntax-to-Safety Gap'' -- the disconnect between AI-generated syntactically correct commands and their physical safety implications -- as the central challenge in SDL deployment. Our framework addresses this gap through three synergistic components: (1) formally defined Operational Design Domains (ODDs) that constrain system behavior within mathematically verified boundaries, (2) Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) that provide real-time safety guarantees through continuous state-space monitoring, and (3) a novel Transactional Safety Protocol (CRUTD) that ensures atomic consistency between digital planning and physical execution. We ground our theoretical contributions through analysis of existing implementations including UniLabOS and the Osprey architecture, demonstrating how these systems instantiate key safety principles. Evaluation against the LabSafety Bench reveals that current foundation models exhibit significant safety failures, demonstrating that architectural safety mechanisms are essential rather than optional. Our framework provides both theoretical foundations and practical implementation guidance for safe deployment of autonomous scientific systems, establishing the groundwork for responsible acceleration of AI-driven discovery.

Abstract: Supernumerary robotic limbs (SLs) have the potential to transform a wide range of human activities, yet their usability remains limited by key technical challenges, particularly in ensuring safety and achieving versatile control. Here, we address the critical problem of maintaining balance in the human-SLs system, a prerequisite for safe and comfortable augmentation tasks. Unlike previous approaches that developed SLs specifically for stability support, we propose a general framework for preserving balance with SLs designed for generic use. Our hierarchical three-layer architecture consists of: (i) a prediction layer that estimates human trunk and center of mass (CoM) dynamics, (ii) a planning layer that generates optimal CoM trajectories to counteract trunk movements and computes the corresponding SL control inputs, and (iii) a control layer that executes these inputs on the SL hardware. We evaluated the framework with ten participants performing forward and lateral bending tasks. The results show a clear reduction in stance instability, demonstrating the framework's effectiveness in enhancing balance. This work paves the path towards safe and versatile human-SLs interactions.

Abstract: Mobile robots operating in agroindustrial environments, such as Mediterranean greenhouses, are subject to challenging conditions, including uneven terrain, variable friction, payload changes, and terrain slopes, all of which significantly affect control performance and stability. Despite the increasing adoption of robotic platforms in agriculture, the lack of standardized, reproducible benchmarks impedes fair comparisons and systematic evaluations of control strategies under realistic operating conditions. This paper presents a comprehensive benchmarking framework for evaluating mobile robot controllers in greenhouse environments. The proposed framework integrates an accurate three dimensional model of the environment, a physics based simulator, and a hierarchical control architecture comprising low, mid, and high level control layers. Three benchmark categories are defined to enable modular assessment, ranging from actuator level control to full autonomous navigation. Additionally, three disturbance scenarios payload variation, terrain type, and slope are explicitly modeled to replicate real world agricultural conditions. To ensure objective and reproducible evaluation, standardized performance metrics are introduced, including the Squared Absolute Error (SAE), the Squared Control Input (SCI), and composite performance indices. Statistical analysis based on repeated trials is employed to mitigate the influence of sensor noise and environmental variability. The framework is further enhanced by a plugin based architecture that facilitates seamless integration of user defined controllers and planners. The proposed benchmark provides a robust and extensible tool for the quantitative comparison of classical, predictive, and planning based control strategies in realistic conditions, bridging the gap between simulation based analysis and real world agroindustrial applications.

Abstract: Self-propelling robotic capsules eliminate shaft looping of conventional colonoscopy, reducing patient discomfort. However, reliably moving within the slippery, viscoelastic environment of the colon remains a significant challenge. We present OSCAR, an ovipositor-inspired self-propelling capsule robot that translates the transport strategy of parasitic wasps into a propulsion mechanism for colonoscopy. OSCAR mechanically encodes the ovipositor-inspired motion pattern through a spring-loaded cam system that drives twelve circumferential sliders in a coordinated, phase-shifted sequence. By tuning the motion profile to maximize the retract phase relative to the advance phase, the capsule creates a controlled friction anisotropy at the interface that generates net forward thrust. We developed an analytical model incorporating a Kelvin-Voigt formulation to capture the viscoelastic stick--slip interactions between the sliders and the tissue, linking the asymmetry between advance and retract phase durations to mean thrust, and slider-reversal synchronization to thrust stability. Comprehensive force characterization experiments in ex-vivo porcine colon revealed a mean steady-state traction force of 0.85 N, closely matching the model. Furthermore, experiments confirmed that thrust generation is speed-independent and scales linearly with the phase asymmetry, in agreement with theoretical predictions, underscoring the capsule's predictable performance and scalability. In locomotion validation experiments, OSCAR demonstrated robust performance, achieving an average speed of 3.08 mm/s, a velocity sufficient to match the cecal intubation times of conventional colonoscopy. By coupling phase-encoded friction anisotropy with a predictive model, OSCAR delivers controllable thrust generation at low normal loads, enabling safer and more robust self-propelling locomotion for robotic capsule colonoscopy.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Dexterous grasping is fundamental to robotics, yet data-driven grasp prediction heavily relies on large, diverse datasets that are costly to generate and typically limited to a narrow set of gripper morphologies. Analytical grasp synthesis can be used to scale data collection, but necessary simplifying assumptions often yield physically infeasible grasps that need to be filtered in high-fidelity simulators, significantly reducing the total number of grasps and their diversity.
  We propose a scalable generate-and-refine pipeline for synthesizing large-scale, diverse, and physically feasible grasps. Instead of using high-fidelity simulators solely for verification and filtering, we leverage them as an optimization stage that continuously improves grasp quality without discarding precomputed candidates. More specifically, we initialize an evolutionary search with a seed set of analytically generated, potentially suboptimal grasps. We then refine these proposals directly in a high-fidelity simulator (Isaac Sim) using an asynchronous, gradient-free evolutionary algorithm, improving stability while maintaining diversity. In addition, this refinement stage can be guided toward human preferences and/or domain-specific quality metrics without requiring a differentiable objective. We further distill the refined grasp distribution into a diffusion model for robust real-world deployment, and highlight the role of diversity for both effective training and during deployment. Experiments on a newly introduced Handles dataset and a DexGraspNet subset demonstrate that our approach achieves over 120 distinct stable grasps per object (a 1.7-6x improvement over unrefined analytical methods) while outperforming diffusion-based alternatives by 46-60\% in unique grasp coverage.

Abstract: Remote Operation is touted as being key to the rapid deployment of automated vehicles. Streaming imagery to control connected vehicles remotely currently requires a reliable, high throughput network connection, which can be limited in real-world remote operation deployments relying on public network infrastructure. This paper investigates how the application of computer vision assisted semantic communication can be used to circumvent data loss and corruption associated with traditional image compression techniques. By encoding the segmentations of detected road users into colour coded highlights within low resolution greyscale imagery, the required data rate can be reduced by 50 \% compared with conventional techniques, while maintaining visual clarity. This enables a median glass-to-glass latency of below 200ms even when the network data rate is below 500kbit/s, while clearly outlining salient road users to enhance situational awareness of the remote operator. The approach is demonstrated in an area of variable 4G mobile connectivity using an automated last-mile delivery vehicle. With this technique, the results indicate that large-scale deployment of remotely operated automated vehicles could be possible even on the often constrained public 4G/5G mobile network, providing the potential to expedite the nationwide roll-out of automated vehicles.

Abstract: Imitation learning frameworks that learn robot control policies from demonstrators' motions via hand-mounted demonstration interfaces have attracted increasing attention. However, due to differences in physical characteristics between demonstrators and robots, this approach faces two limitations: i) the demonstration data do not include robot actions, and ii) the demonstrated motions may be infeasible for robots. These limitations make policy learning difficult. To address them, we propose Feasibility-Aware Behavior Cloning from Observation (FABCO). FABCO integrates behavior cloning from observation, which complements robot actions using robot dynamics models, with feasibility estimation. In feasibility estimation, the demonstrated motions are evaluated using a robot-dynamics model, learned from the robot's execution data, to assess reproducibility under the robot's dynamics. The estimated feasibility is used for multimodal feedback and feasibility-aware policy learning to improve the demonstrator's motions and learn robust policies. Multimodal feedback provides feasibility through the demonstrator's visual and haptic senses to promote feasible demonstrated motions. Feasibility-aware policy learning reduces the influence of demonstrated motions that are infeasible for robots, enabling the learning of policies that robots can execute stably. We conducted experiments with 15 participants on two tasks and confirmed that FABCO improves imitation learning performance by more than 3.2 times compared to the case without feasibility feedback.

The main performance criteria are the magnitude of the estimation or prediction error, the computational effort and the robustness of each method to non-Gaussian noise. Among the different techniques compared are the well known Kalman filters and their different variants (e.g. extended and unscented), and the more recent techniques relying on Sequential Monte Carlo Sampling methods, such as particle filters and Gaussian Mixture Sigma Point Particle Filter.

Abstract: Magnetic actuation enables surgical robots to navigate complex anatomical pathways while reducing tissue trauma and improving surgical precision. However, clinical deployment is limited by the challenges of controlling such systems under fluoroscopic imaging, which provides low frame rate and noisy pose feedback. This paper presents a control framework that remains accurate and stable under such conditions by combining a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) framework that directly outputs coil currents, an analytically differentiable magnetic field model based on Zernike polynomials, and a Kalman filter to estimate the robot state. Experimental validation is conducted with two magnetic robots in a 3D-printed fluid workspace and a spine phantom replicating drug delivery in the epidural space. Results show the proposed control method remains highly accurate when feedback is downsampled to 3 Hz with added Gaussian noise (sigma = 2 mm), mimicking clinical fluoroscopy. In the spine phantom experiments, the proposed method successfully executed a drug delivery trajectory with a root mean square (RMS) position error of 1.18 mm while maintaining safe clearance from critical anatomical boundaries.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models leveraging the native autoregressive paradigm of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated superior instruction-following and training efficiency. Central to this paradigm is action tokenization, yet its design has primarily focused on reconstruction fidelity, failing to address its direct impact on VLA optimization. Consequently, the fundamental question of \textit{what makes for good action tokenizers} remains unanswered. In this paper, we bridge this gap by establishing design principles specifically from the perspective of VLA optimization. We identify a set of best practices based on information-theoretic insights, including maximized temporal token overlap, minimized vocabulary redundancy, enhanced multimodal mutual information, and token independence. Guided by these principles, we introduce \textbf{ActionCodec}, a high-performance action tokenizer that significantly enhances both training efficiency and VLA performance across diverse simulation and real-world benchmarks. Notably, on LIBERO, a SmolVLM2-2.2B fine-tuned with ActionCodec achieves a 95.5\% success rate without any robotics pre-training. With advanced architectural enhancements, this reaches 97.4\%, representing a new SOTA for VLA models without robotics pre-training. We believe our established design principles, alongside the released model, will provide a clear roadmap for the community to develop more effective action tokenizers.

We evaluate the architecture through a 32.25-minute indoor quadrotor flight test using vision-based navigation. The vision system achieved 87.19 Hz position estimation with 99.90\% data continuity and 11.47 ms mean latency, validating real-time performance requirements. All 15 ground commands executed successfully with 100 % success rate, demonstrating robust F'--PX4 integration. System resource utilization remained low (15.19 % CPU, 1,244 MB RAM) with zero stale telemetry messages, confirming efficient operation on embedded platforms. Results validate the feasibility of hybrid flight-software architectures combining certification-grade determinism with flexible autonomy for autonomous aerial vehicles.

Abstract: A navigable agent needs to understand both high-level semantic instructions and precise spatial perceptions. Building navigation agents centered on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrates a promising solution due to their powerful generalization ability. However, the current tightly coupled design dramatically limits system performance. In this work, we propose a decoupled design that separates low-level spatial state estimation from high-level semantic planning. Unlike previous methods that rely on predefined, oversimplified textual maps, we introduce an interactive metric world representation that maintains rich and consistent information, allowing MLLMs to interact with and reason on it for decision-making. Furthermore, counterfactual reasoning is introduced to further elicit MLLMs' capacity, while the metric world representation ensures the physical validity of the produced actions. We conduct comprehensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments. Our method establishes a new zero-shot state-of-the-art, achieving 48.8\% Success Rate (SR) in R2R-CE and 42.2\% in RxR-CE benchmarks. Furthermore, to validate the versatility of our metric representation, we demonstrate zero-shot sim-to-real transfer across diverse embodiments, including a wheeled TurtleBot 4 and a custom-built aerial drone. These real-world deployments verify that our decoupled framework serves as a robust, domain-invariant interface for embodied Vision-and-Language navigation.

Abstract: In this letter, Lyapunov-based synthesis of a PI-like controller is proposed for $\mathcal{L}_2$-stable motion control of an independently driven and steered four-wheel mobile robot. An explicit, structurally verified model is used to enable systematic controller design with stability and performance guarantees suitable for real-time operation. A Lyapunov function is constructed to yield explicit bounds and $\mathcal{L}_2$ stability results, supporting feedback synthesis that reduces configuration dependent effects. The resulting control law maintains a PI-like form suitable for standard embedded implementation while preserving rigorous stability properties. Effectiveness and robustness are demonstrated experimentally on a real four-wheel mobile robot platform.

Abstract: Deploying Multimodal Large Language Models as the brain of embodied agents remains challenging, particularly under long-horizon observations and limited context budgets. Existing memory assisted methods often rely on textual summaries, which discard rich visual and spatial details and remain brittle in non-stationary environments. In this work, we propose a non-parametric memory framework that explicitly disentangles episodic and semantic memory for embodied exploration and question answering. Our retrieval-first, reasoning-assisted paradigm recalls episodic experiences via semantic similarity and verifies them through visual reasoning, enabling robust reuse of past observations without rigid geometric alignment. In parallel, we introduce a program-style rule extraction mechanism that converts experiences into structured, reusable semantic memory, facilitating cross-environment generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on embodied question answering and exploration benchmarks, yielding a 7.3% gain in LLM-Match and an 11.4% gain in LLM MatchXSPL on A-EQA, as well as +7.7% success rate and +6.8% SPL on GOAT-Bench. Analyses reveal that our episodic memory primarily improves exploration efficiency, while semantic memory strengthens complex reasoning of embodied agents.

Abstract: Efficiently training control policies for robots is a major challenge that can greatly benefit from utilizing knowledge gained from training similar systems through cross-embodiment knowledge transfer. In this work, we focus on accelerating policy training using a library-based initialization scheme that enables effective knowledge transfer across multirotor configurations. By leveraging a physics-aware neural control architecture that combines a reinforcement learning-based controller and a supervised control allocation network, we enable the reuse of previously trained policies. To this end, we utilize a policy evaluation-based similarity measure that identifies suitable policies for initialization from a library. We demonstrate that this measure correlates with the reduction in environment interactions needed to reach target performance and is therefore suited for initialization. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments confirm that our control architecture achieves state-of-the-art control performance, and that our initialization scheme saves on average up to $73.5\%$ of environment interactions (compared to training a policy from scratch) across diverse quadrotor and hexarotor designs, paving the way for efficient cross-embodiment transfer in reinforcement learning.

Abstract: In robotics, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models that integrate diverse multimodal signals from multi-view inputs have emerged as an effective approach. However, most prior work adopts static fusion that processes all visual inputs uniformly, which incurs unnecessary computational overhead and allows task-irrelevant background information to act as noise. Inspired by the principles of human active perception, we propose a dynamic information fusion framework designed to maximize the efficiency and robustness of VLA models. Our approach introduces a lightweight adaptive routing architecture that analyzes the current text prompt and observations from a wrist-mounted camera in real-time to predict the task-relevance of multiple camera views. By conditionally attenuating computations for views with low informational utility and selectively providing only essential visual features to the policy network, Our framework achieves computation efficiency proportional to task relevance. Furthermore, to efficiently secure large-scale annotation data for router training, we established an automated labeling pipeline utilizing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to minimize data collection and annotation costs. Experimental results in real-world robotic manipulation scenarios demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves significant improvements in both inference efficiency and control performance compared to existing VLA models, validating the effectiveness and practicality of dynamic information fusion in resource-constrained, real-time robot control environments.

Abstract: Vision-language model (VLM) shows promise for high-level planning in smart manufacturing, yet their deployment in dynamic workcells faces two critical challenges: (1) stateless operation, they cannot persistently track out-of-view states, causing world-state drift; and (2) opaque reasoning, failures are difficult to diagnose, leading to costly blind retries. This paper presents VLM-DEWM, a cognitive architecture that decouples VLM reasoning from world-state management through a persistent, queryable Dynamic External World Model (DEWM). Each VLM decision is structured into an Externalizable Reasoning Trace (ERT), comprising action proposal, world belief, and causal assumption, which is validated against DEWM before execution. When failures occur, discrepancy analysis between predicted and observed states enables targeted recovery instead of global replanning. We evaluate VLM-DEWM on multi-station assembly, large-scale facility exploration, and real-robot recovery under induced failures. Compared to baseline memory-augmented VLM systems, VLM DEWM improves state-tracking accuracy from 56% to 93%, increases recovery success rate from below 5% to 95%, and significantly reduces computational overhead through structured memory. These results establish VLM-DEWM as a verifiable and resilient solution for long-horizon robotic operations in dynamic manufacturing environments.

Abstract: Assessing human muscle fatigue is critical for optimizing performance and safety in physical human-robot interaction(pHRI). This work presents a data-driven framework to estimate fatigue in dynamic, cyclic pHRI using arm-mounted surface electromyography(sEMG). Subject-specific machine-learning regression models(Random Forest, XGBoost, and Linear Regression predict the fraction of cycles to fatigue(FCF) from three frequency-domain and one time-domain EMG features, and are benchmarked against a convolutional neural network(CNN) that ingests spectrograms of filtered EMG. Framing fatigue estimation as regression (rather than classification) captures continuous progression toward fatigue, supporting earlier detection, timely intervention, and adaptive robot control. In experiments with ten participants, a collaborative robot under admittance control guided repetitive lateral (left-right) end-effector motions until muscular fatigue. Average FCF RMSE across participants was 20.8+/-4.3% for the CNN, 23.3+/-3.8% for Random Forest, 24.8+/-4.5% for XGBoost, and 26.9+/-6.1% for Linear Regression. To probe cross-task generalization, one participant additionally performed unseen vertical (up-down) and circular repetitions; models trained only on lateral data were tested directly and largely retained accuracy, indicating robustness to changes in movement direction, arm kinematics, and muscle recruitment, while Linear Regression deteriorated. Overall, the study shows that both feature-based ML and spectrogram-based DL can estimate remaining work capacity during repetitive pHRI, with the CNN delivering the lowest error and the tree-based models close behind. The reported transfer to new motion patterns suggests potential for practical fatigue monitoring without retraining for every task, improving operator protection and enabling fatigue-aware shared autonomy, for safer fatigue-adaptive pHRI control.

Abstract: Robot motion distributions often exhibit multi-modality and require flexible generative models for accurate representation. Streaming Flow Policies (SFPs) have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for generating robot trajectories by integrating learned velocity fields directly in action space, enabling smooth and reactive control. However, existing formulations lack mechanisms for adapting trajectories post-training to enforce safety and task-specific constraints. We propose Constraint-Aware Streaming Flow (CASF), a framework that augments streaming flow policies with constraint-dependent metrics that reshape the learned velocity field during execution. CASF models each constraint, defined in either the robot's workspace or configuration space, as a differentiable distance function that is converted into a local metric and pulled back into the robot's control space. Far from restricted regions, the resulting metric reduces to the identity; near constraint boundaries, it smoothly attenuates or redirects motion, effectively deforming the underlying flow to maintain safety. This allows trajectories to be adapted in real time, ensuring that robot actions respect joint limits, avoid collisions, and remain within feasible workspaces, while preserving the multi-modal and reactive properties of streaming flow policies. We demonstrate CASF in simulated and real-world manipulation tasks, showing that it produces constraint-satisfying trajectories that remain smooth, feasible, and dynamically consistent, outperforming standard post-hoc projection baselines.

Abstract: Robot-assisted feeding enables people with disabilities who require assistance eating to enjoy a meal independently and with dignity. However, existing systems have only been tested in-lab or in-home, leaving in-the-wild social dining contexts (e.g., restaurants) largely unexplored. Designing a robot for such contexts presents unique challenges, such as dynamic and unsupervised dining environments that a robot needs to account for and respond to. Through speculative participatory design with people with disabilities, supported by semi-structured interviews and a custom AI-based visual storyboarding tool, we uncovered ideal scenarios for in-the-wild social dining. Our key insight suggests that such systems should: embody the principles of a white glove service where the robot (1) supports multimodal inputs and unobtrusive outputs; (2) has contextually sensitive social behavior and prioritizes the user; (3) has expanded roles beyond feeding; (4) adapts to other relationships at the dining table. Our work has implications for in-the-wild and group contexts of robot-assisted feeding.

Abstract: Friction is the essential mediator of terrestrial locomotion, yet in robotic systems it is almost always treated as a passive property fixed by surface materials and conditions. Here, we introduce ultrasonic lubrication as a method to actively control friction in robotic locomotion. By exciting resonant structures at ultrasonic frequencies, contact interfaces can dynamically switch between "grip" and "slip" states, enabling locomotion. We developed two friction control modules, a cylindrical design for lumen-like environments and a flat-plate design for external surfaces, and integrated them into bio-inspired systems modeled after inchworm and wasp ovipositor locomotion. Both systems achieved bidirectional locomotion with nearly perfect locomotion efficiencies that exceeded 90%. Friction characterization experiments further demonstrated substantial friction reduction across various surfaces, including rigid, soft, granular, and biological tissue interfaces, under dry and wet conditions, and on surfaces with different levels of roughness, confirming the broad applicability of ultrasonic lubrication to locomotion tasks. These findings establish ultrasonic lubrication as a viable active friction control mechanism for robotic locomotion, with the potential to reduce design complexity and improve efficiency of robotic locomotion systems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Autonomous landing of Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) on oscillating marine platforms is severely constrained by wave-induced multi-frequency oscillations, wind disturbances, and prediction phase lags in motion prediction. Existing methods either treat platform motion as a general random process or lack explicit modeling of wave spectral characteristics, leading to suboptimal performance under dynamic sea conditions. To address these limitations, we propose SpecFuse: a novel spectral-temporal fusion predictive control framework that integrates frequency-domain wave decomposition with time-domain recursive state estimation for high-precision 6-DoF motion forecasting of Uncrewed Surface Vehicles (USVs). The framework explicitly models dominant wave harmonics to mitigate phase lags, refining predictions in real time via IMU data without relying on complex calibration. Additionally, we design a hierarchical control architecture featuring a sampling-based HPO-RRT* algorithm for dynamic trajectory planning under non-convex constraints and a learning-augmented predictive controller that fuses data-driven disturbance compensation with optimization-based execution. Extensive validations (2,000 simulations + 8 lake experiments) show our approach achieves a 3.2 cm prediction error, 4.46 cm landing deviation, 98.7% / 87.5% success rates (simulation / real-world), and 82 ms latency on embedded hardware, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 44%-48% in accuracy. Its robustness to wave-wind coupling disturbances supports critical maritime missions such as search and rescue and environmental monitoring. All code, experimental configurations, and datasets will be released as open-source to facilitate reproducibility.

Abstract: We present a closed-loop framework for autonomous raceline optimization that combines NURBS-based trajectory representation, CMA-ES global trajectory optimization, and controller-guided spatial feedback. Instead of treating tracking errors as transient disturbances, our method exploits them as informative signals of local track characteristics via a Kalman-inspired spatial update. This enables the construction of an adaptive, acceleration-based constraint map that iteratively refines trajectories toward near-optimal performance under spatially varying track and vehicle behavior. In simulation, our approach achieves a 17.38% lap time reduction compared to a controller parametrized with maximum static acceleration. On real hardware, tested with different tire compounds ranging from high to low friction, we obtain a 7.60% lap time improvement without explicitly parametrizing friction. This demonstrates robustness to changing grip conditions in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Humanoid motion control has witnessed significant breakthroughs in recent years, with deep reinforcement learning (RL) emerging as a primary catalyst for achieving complex, human-like behaviors. However, the high dimensionality and intricate dynamics of humanoid robots make manual motion design impractical, leading to a heavy reliance on expensive motion capture (MoCap) data. These datasets are not only costly to acquire but also frequently lack the necessary geometric context of the surrounding physical environment. Consequently, existing motion synthesis frameworks often suffer from a decoupling of motion and scene, resulting in physical inconsistencies such as contact slippage or mesh penetration during terrain-aware tasks. In this work, we present MeshMimic, an innovative framework that bridges 3D scene reconstruction and embodied intelligence to enable humanoid robots to learn coupled "motion-terrain" interactions directly from video. By leveraging state-of-the-art 3D vision models, our framework precisely segments and reconstructs both human trajectories and the underlying 3D geometry of terrains and objects. We introduce an optimization algorithm based on kinematic consistency to extract high-quality motion data from noisy visual reconstructions, alongside a contact-invariant retargeting method that transfers human-environment interaction features to the humanoid agent. Experimental results demonstrate that MeshMimic achieves robust, highly dynamic performance across diverse and challenging terrains. Our approach proves that a low-cost pipeline utilizing only consumer-grade monocular sensors can facilitate the training of complex physical interactions, offering a scalable path toward the autonomous evolution of humanoid robots in unstructured environments.

Abstract: Embodied Question Answering (EQA) combines visual scene understanding, goal-directed exploration, spatial and temporal reasoning under partial observability. A central challenge is to confine physical search to question-relevant subspaces while maintaining a compact, actionable memory of observations. Furthermore, for real-world deployment, fast inference time during exploration is crucial. We introduce FAST-EQA, a question-conditioned framework that (i) identifies likely visual targets, (ii) scores global regions of interest to guide navigation, and (iii) employs Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning over visual memory to answer confidently. FAST-EQA maintains a bounded scene memory that stores a fixed-capacity set of region-target hypotheses and updates them online, enabling robust handling of both single and multi-target questions without unbounded growth. To expand coverage efficiently, a global exploration policy treats narrow openings and doors as high-value frontiers, complementing local target seeking with minimal computation. Together, these components focus the agent's attention, improve scene coverage, and improve answer reliability while running substantially faster than prior approaches. On HMEQA and EXPRESS-Bench, FAST-EQA achieves state-of-the-art performance, while performing competitively on OpenEQA and MT-HM3D.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: While recent advances in humanoid locomotion have achieved stable walking on varied terrains, capturing the agility and adaptivity of highly dynamic human motions remains an open challenge. In particular, agile parkour in complex environments demands not only low-level robustness, but also human-like motion expressiveness, long-horizon skill composition, and perception-driven decision-making. In this paper, we present Perceptive Humanoid Parkour (PHP), a modular framework that enables humanoid robots to autonomously perform long-horizon, vision-based parkour across challenging obstacle courses. Our approach first leverages motion matching, formulated as nearest-neighbor search in a feature space, to compose retargeted atomic human skills into long-horizon kinematic trajectories. This framework enables the flexible composition and smooth transition of complex skill chains while preserving the elegance and fluidity of dynamic human motions. Next, we train motion-tracking reinforcement learning (RL) expert policies for these composed motions, and distill them into a single depth-based, multi-skill student policy, using a combination of DAgger and RL. Crucially, the combination of perception and skill composition enables autonomous, context-aware decision-making: using only onboard depth sensing and a discrete 2D velocity command, the robot selects and executes whether to step over, climb onto, vault or roll off obstacles of varying geometries and heights. We validate our framework with extensive real-world experiments on a Unitree G1 humanoid robot, demonstrating highly dynamic parkour skills such as climbing tall obstacles up to 1.25m (96% robot height), as well as long-horizon multi-obstacle traversal with closed-loop adaptation to real-time obstacle perturbations.

Abstract: Learning generalist policies capable of accomplishing a plethora of everyday tasks remains an open challenge in dexterous manipulation. In particular, collecting large-scale manipulation data via real-world teleoperation is expensive and difficult to scale. While learning in simulation provides a feasible alternative, designing multiple task-specific environments and rewards for training is similarly challenging. We propose Dex4D, a framework that instead leverages simulation for learning task-agnostic dexterous skills that can be flexibly recomposed to perform diverse real-world manipulation tasks. Specifically, Dex4D learns a domain-agnostic 3D point track conditioned policy capable of manipulating any object to any desired pose. We train this 'Anypose-to-Anypose' policy in simulation across thousands of objects with diverse pose configurations, covering a broad space of robot-object interactions that can be composed at test time. At deployment, this policy can be zero-shot transferred to real-world tasks without finetuning, simply by prompting it with desired object-centric point tracks extracted from generated videos. During execution, Dex4D uses online point tracking for closed-loop perception and control. Extensive experiments in simulation and on real robots show that our method enables zero-shot deployment for diverse dexterous manipulation tasks and yields consistent improvements over prior baselines. Furthermore, we demonstrate strong generalization to novel objects, scene layouts, backgrounds, and trajectories, highlighting the robustness and scalability of the proposed framework.

Abstract: Carbon-ion radiotherapy provides high dose conformity for lung cancer, but its benefit is limited by two sources of uncertainties: interplay between scanned beam delivery and tumor motion, and dose modulation from heterogeneous lung tissue. This study quantifies the separate and combined dosimetric impact of these effects using the GSI TRiP4D treatment planning system. Eighteen lung cancer 4DCT datasets from TCIA were analyzed. A modulation power ($P_{\mathrm{mod}}$) was assigned to lung voxels. Three values were sampled from a Gaussian distribution ($200μ\mathrm{m} \pm 67μ\mathrm{m}$), and an extreme value of $750μ\mathrm{m}$ was tested. Interplay doses were computed by combining scanned-beam delivery with patient-specific respiratory motion. Four scenarios were studied: static, static with modulation, interplay, and interplay with modulation. Metrics included $D95\%$, $V95\%$, homogeneity index (HI), lung $V16\mathrm{Gy}$, and heart $V20\mathrm{Gy}$. Interplay reduced target coverage by $5.2 \pm 1.5$ pp ($D95\%$), $12.1 \pm 5.9$ pp ($V95\%$), and $8.3 \pm 2.4$ pp (HI). Extreme $P_{\mathrm{mod}}$ alone caused small degradations. When combined with interplay, it partially compensated the loss. This effect decreased with 4D optimization. Fractionation mitigated interplay, leaving lung modulation as the main residual effect.

Abstract: We present StrokeNeXt, a model for stroke classification in 2D Computed Tomography (CT) images. StrokeNeXt employs a dual-branch design with two ConvNeXt encoders, whose features are fused through a lightweight convolutional decoder based on stacked 1D operations, including a bottleneck projection and transformation layers, and a compact classification head. The model is evaluated on a curated dataset of 6,774 CT images, addressing both stroke detection and subtype classification between ischemic and hemorrhage cases. StrokeNeXt consistently outperforms convolutional and Transformer-based baselines, reaching accuracies and F1-scores of up to 0.988. Paired statistical tests confirm that the performance gains are statistically significant, while class-wise sensitivity and specificity demonstrate robust behavior across diagnostic categories. Calibration analysis shows reduced prediction error compared to competing methods, and confusion matrix results indicate low misclassification rates. In addition, the model exhibits low inference time and fast convergence.

Abstract: Non-reference metrics (NRMs) can assess the visual quality of images and videos without a reference, making them well-suited for the evaluation of user-generated content. Nonetheless, rate-distortion optimization (RDO) in video coding is still mainly driven by full-reference metrics, such as the sum of squared errors, which treat the input as an ideal target. A way to incorporate NRMs into RDO is through linearization (LNRM), where the gradient of the NRM with respect to the input guides bit allocation. While this strategy improves the quality predicted by some metrics, we show that it can yield limited gains or degradations when evaluated with other NRMs. We argue that NRMs are highly non-linear predictors with locally unstable gradients that can compromise the quality of the linearization; furthermore, optimizing a single metric may exploit model-specific biases that do not generalize across quality estimators. Motivated by this observation, we extend the LNRM framework to optimize ensembles of NRMs and, to further improve robustness, we introduce a smoothing-based formulation that stabilizes NRM gradients prior to linearization. Our framework is well-suited to hybrid codecs, and we advocate for its use with overfitted codecs, where it avoids iterative evaluations and backpropagation of neural network-based NRMs, reducing encoder complexity relative to direct NRM optimization. We validate the proposed approach on AVC and Cool-chic, using the YouTube UGC dataset. Experiments demonstrate consistent bitrate savings across multiple NRMs with no decoder complexity overhead and, for Cool-chic, a substantial reduction in encoding runtime compared to direct NRM optimization.

Abstract: The growing complexity in home energy management demands advanced systems that guide occupants toward informed energy decisions. Large language model (LLM)-integrated home energy management systems (HEMS) have shown promise, but prior studies relied on prompt engineering or pre-built platforms with limited customization of agent behavior, or assessed performance through single-turn or -task evaluations. This study introduces a multi-agent home energy management assistant (HEMA), built on LangChain and LangGraph, designed to adaptively and intelligently handle real-world use cases of HEMS with full system customization capability. It carefully classifies user queries via a self-consistency classifier, requests three specialized agents (Analysis, Knowledge, and Control) to prepare accurate, adaptive responses using purpose-built analysis and control tools and retrieval augmented generation under the reasoning and acting mechanism. HEMA was rigorously assessed using two different experimental analyses via an LLM-as-user approach: (1) analytical and informative capabilities using combinatorial test cases of various personas and differing scenarios against three alternative system configurations relying on vanilla LLM and (2) control capabilities using various control scenarios. Out of 295 test cases, HEMA acquired a 91.9% goal achievement rate, successfully fulfilling user requests while providing high levels of factual accuracy, action correctness, interaction quality, and system efficiency, especially when compared to alternative system configurations. Collectively, this study contributes to the advancement of the human-centered design of LLM-integrated HEMS by demonstrating the feasibility and value of agentic architectures, and by clarifying the architectural requirements and evaluation criteria necessary to support adaptive, sustained human-artificial intelligence collaboration in HEMS.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in emergency first response (EFR) applications to support situational awareness (SA) and decision-making, yet most operate on text or 2D imagery and offer little support for core EFR SA competencies like spatial reasoning. We address this gap by evaluating a prototype that fuses robot-mounted depth sensing and YOLO detection with a vision language model (VLM) capable of verbalizing metrically-grounded distances of detected objects (e.g., the chair is 3.02 meters away). In a mixed-reality toxic-smoke scenario, participants estimated distances to a victim and an exit window under three conditions: video-only, depth-agnostic VLM, and depth-augmented VLM. Depth-augmentation improved objective accuracy and stability, e.g., the victim and window distance estimation error dropped, while raising situational awareness without increasing workload. Conversely, depth- agnostic assistance increased workload and slightly worsened accuracy. We contribute to human SA augmentation by demonstrating that metrically grounded, object-centric verbal information supports spatial reasoning in EFR and improves decision-relevant judgments under time pressure.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL)-based biomechanical simulations have the potential to revolutionise HCI research and interaction design, but currently lack usability and interpretability. Using the Human Action Cycle as a design lens, we identify key limitations of biomechanical RL frameworks and develop MyoInteract, a novel framework for fast prototyping of biomechanical HCI tasks. MyoInteract allows designers to setup tasks, user models, and training parameters from an easy-to-use GUI within minutes. It trains and evaluates muscle-actuated simulated users within minutes, reducing training times by up to 98%. A workshop study with 12 interaction designers revealed that MyoInteract allowed novices in biomechanical RL to successfully setup, train, and assess goal-directed user movements within a single session. By transforming biomechanical RL from a days-long expert task into an accessible hour-long workflow, this work significantly lowers barriers to entry and accelerates iteration cycles in HCI biomechanics research.

Abstract: Recent empirical research by Sharma et al. (2026) demonstrated that AI assistant interactions carry meaningful potential for situational human disempowerment, including reality distortion, value judgment distortion, and action distortion. While this work provides a critical diagnosis of the problem, concrete pedagogical interventions remain underexplored. I present an AI literacy framework built around eight cross-cutting Learning Outcomes (LOs), developed independently through teaching practice and subsequently found to align with Sharma et al.'s disempowerment taxonomy. I report a case study from a publicly available online course, where a co-teaching methodology--with AI serving as an active voice co-instructor--was used to deliver this framework. Drawing on inoculation theory (McGuire, 1961)--a well-established persuasion research framework recently applied to misinformation prebunking by the Cambridge school (van der Linden, 2022; Roozenbeek & van der Linden, 2019)--I argue that AI literacy cannot be acquired through declarative knowledge alone, but requires guided exposure to AI failure modes, including the sycophantic validation and authority projection patterns identified by Sharma et al. This application of inoculation theory to AI-specific distortion is, to my knowledge, novel. I discuss the convergence between the pedagogically-derived framework and Sharma et al.'s empirically-derived taxonomy, and argue that this convergence--two independent approaches arriving at similar problem descriptions--strengthens the case for both the diagnosis and the proposed educational response.

Abstract: Combining conversational AI with refreshable tactile displays (RTDs) offers significant potential for creating accessible data visualization for people who are blind or have low vision (BLV). To support researchers and developers building accessible data visualizations with RTDs, we present a multimodal data interaction architecture along with an open-source reference implementation. Our system is the first to combine touch input with a conversational agent on an RTD, enabling deictic queries that fuse touch context with spoken language, such as "what is the trend between these points?" The architecture addresses key technical challenges, including touch sensing on RTDs, visual-to-tactile encoding, integrating touch context with conversational AI, and synchronizing multimodal output. Our contributions are twofold: (1) a technical architecture integrating RTD hardware, external touch sensing, and conversational AI to enable multimodal data interaction; and (2) an open-source reference implementation demonstrating its feasibility. This work provides a technical foundation to support future research in multimodal accessible data visualization.

Abstract: This study explores a handheld, battery-operated e-ink device displaying Google Scholar citation statistics. The StatCounter places academic metrics into the flow of daily life rather than a desktop context. The work draws on a first-person, longitudinal auto-ethnographic inquiry examining how constant access to scholarly metrics influences motivation, attention, reflection, and emotional responses across work and non-work settings. The ambient proximity and pervasive availability of scholarly metrics invites frequent micro-checks, short reflective pauses, but also introduces moments of second-guessing when numbers drop or stagnate. Carrying the device prompts new narratives about academic identity, including a sense of companionship during travel and periods away from the office. Over time, the presence of the device turns metrics from an occasional reference into an ambient background of scholarly life. The study contributes insight into how situated, embodied access to academic metrics reshapes their meaning, and frames opportunities for designing tools that engage with scholarly evaluation in reflective ways.

Abstract: Social media has billions of users, but we still do not fully understand why users prefer one platform over another. Establishing new platforms among already popular competitors is difficult. Prior research has richly documented people's experiences within individual platforms, yet situating those experiences within the entirety of a user's social media experience remains challenging. What platforms have people used, and why have they transitioned between them? We collected data from a quota-based sample of 1,000 U.S. participants. We introduce the concept of \emph{Social Media Journeys} to study the entirety of their social media experiences systematically. We identify push and pull factors across the social media landscape. We also show how different generations adopted social media platforms based on personal needs. With this work, we advance HCI by moving towards holistic perspectives when discussing social media technology, offering new insights for platform design, governance, and regulation.

We investigate feedback timing and verbosity from agentic LLM-based in-car assistants through a controlled, mixed-methods study (N=45) comparing planned steps and intermediate results feedback against silent operation with final-only response. Using a dual-task paradigm with an in-car voice assistant, we found that intermediate feedback significantly improved perceived speed, trust, and user experience while reducing task load - effects that held across varying task complexities and interaction contexts. Interviews further revealed user preferences for an adaptive approach: high initial transparency to establish trust, followed by progressively reducing verbosity as systems prove reliable, with adjustments based on task stakes and situational context. We translate our empirical findings into design implications for feedback timing and verbosity in agentic assistants, balancing transparency and efficiency.

Abstract: Business plan (BP) writing plays a key role in entrepreneurship education by helping learners construct, evaluate, and iteratively refine their ideas. However, conventional BP writing remains a rigid, linear process that often fails to reflect the dynamic and recursive nature of entrepreneurial ideation. This mismatch is particularly challenging for novice entrepreneurial students, who struggle with the substantial cognitive demands of developing and refining ideas. While reflection and meta-reflection are critical strategies for fostering divergent and convergent thinking, existing writing tools rarely scaffold these higher-order processes. To address this gap, we present the Meflex System, a large language model (LLM)-based writing tool that integrates BP writing scaffolding with a nonlinear idea canvas to support iterative ideation through reflection and meta-reflection. We report findings from an exploratory user study with 30 participants that examined the system's usability and cognitive impact. Results show that Meflex effectively scaffolds BP writing, promotes divergent thinking through LLM-supported reflection, and enhances meta-reflective awareness while reducing cognitive load during complex idea development. These findings highlight the potential of non-linear LLM-based writing tools to foster deeper and coherent entrepreneurial thinking.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) increasingly integrates into crowdfunding practices, strategic disclosure of AI involvement has become critical. Yet, empirical insights into how different disclosure strategies influence investor decisions remain limited. Drawing on signaling theory and Aristotle's rhetorical framework, we examine how mandatory AI disclosure affects crowdfunding performance and how substantive signals (degree of AI involvement) and rhetorical signals (logos/explicitness, ethos/authenticity, pathos/emotional tone) moderate these effects. Leveraging Kickstarter's mandatory AI disclosure policy as a natural experiment and four supplementary online experiments, we find that mandatory AI disclosure significantly reduces crowdfunding performance: funds raised decline by 39.8% and backer counts by 23.9% for AI-involved projects. However, this adverse effect is systematically moderated by disclosure strategy. Greater AI involvement amplifies the negative effects of AI disclosure, while high authenticity and high explicitness mitigate them. Interestingly, excessive positive emotional tone (a strategy creators might intuitively adopt to counteract AI skepticism) backfires and exacerbates negative outcomes. Supplementary randomized experiments identify two underlying mechanisms: perceived creator competence and AI washing concerns. Substantive signals primarily affect competence judgments, whereas rhetorical signals operate through varied pathways: either mediator alone or both in sequence. These findings provide theoretical and practical insights for entrepreneurs, platforms, and policymakers strategically managing AI transparency in high-stakes investment contexts.

Abstract: Integrating human expertise into machine learning systems often reduces the role of experts to labeling oracles, a paradigm that limits the amount of information exchanged and fails to capture the nuances of human judgment. We address this challenge by developing a human-in-the-loop framework to learn binary classifiers with rich query types, consisting of item ranking and exemplar selection. We first introduce probabilistic human response models for these rich queries motivated by the relationship experimentally observed between the perceived implicit score of an item and its distance to the unknown classifier. Using these models, we then design active learning algorithms that leverage the rich queries to increase the information gained per interaction. We provide theoretical bounds on sample complexity and develop a tractable and computationally efficient variational approximation. Through experiments with simulated annotators derived from crowdsourced word-sentiment and image-aesthetic datasets, we demonstrate significant reductions on sample complexity. We further extend active learning strategies to select queries that maximize information rate, explicitly balancing informational value against annotation cost. This algorithm in the word sentiment classification task reduces learning time by more than 57\% compared to traditional label-only active learning.

Abstract: Social media platforms have rapidly adopted algorithmic curation with little consideration for the potential harm to users' mental well-being. We present findings from design workshops with 21 participants diagnosed with mental illness about their interactions with social media platforms. We find that users develop cause-and-effect explanations, or folk theories, to understand their experiences with algorithmic curation. These folk theories highlight a breakdown in algorithmic design that we explain using the framework of entanglement, a phenomenon where there is a disconnect between users' actions and platform outcomes on an emotional level. Participants' designs to address entanglement and mitigate harms centered on contextualizing their engagement and restoring explicit user control on social media. The conceptualization of entanglement and the resulting design recommendations have implications for social computing and recommender systems research, particularly in evaluating and designing social media platforms that support users' mental well-being.
