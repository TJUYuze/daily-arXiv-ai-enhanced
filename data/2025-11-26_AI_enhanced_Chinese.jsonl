We have recruited 36 healthy pregnant women to undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) between 29 and 42 weeks of pregnancy to further explore this occurrence in a single centre prospective observational study. Participants had fetal ultrasound to confirm normal growth. Dynamic MRI was acquired for between 15 and 32 minutes using respiratory triggered, multi-slice, single shot, gradient echo, echo planar imaging covering the whole uterus. All participants had a live birth of a healthy baby weighing over the 10th centile for gestational age and no conditions associated with placental dysfunction e.g. pre-eclampsia. There were no cases of severe maternal or fetal villous malperfusion on placental histopathology. Visible contractions were recorded for all participants who completed MRI scans. Contractions involving a decrease in placental volume >10% were classified as either placental or uterine by visual observation. Placental contractions occurred more frequently than uterine contractions (p=0.0061), were associated with a larger increase in the surface area of the uterine wall not covered by the placenta (p=0.0015), sphericity of the placenta(p<0.0001) and longer durations (p=0.0151). Contractions led to an increase in the MRI parameter R2* in the placenta. There was large variation both between participants and between contractions from the same individual, in terms of the time course and features of contractions. Rate, duration and other features of contractions did not apparently change across the gestational age range studied, although the largest fractional volume changes were detected at early gestation. We found that placental contractions occurred in at least 60% of our healthy pregnant population with a median frequency of 2 per hour and median duration of 2.4 minutes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7MRI\u89c2\u5bdf\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u5065\u5eb7\u5b55\u5987\u4e2d\u80ce\u76d8\u6536\u7f29\u6bd4\u5b50\u5bab\u6536\u7f29\u66f4\u9891\u7e41\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u80ce\u76d8\u4f53\u79ef\u51cf\u5c11\u3001\u5b50\u5bab\u58c1\u8868\u9762\u79ef\u589e\u52a0\u3001\u80ce\u76d8\u7403\u5f62\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u4ee5\u53ca\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u66f4\u957f\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a2\u7d222020\u5e74\u9996\u6b21\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u5b50\u5bab-\u80ce\u76d8\u6cf5\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u4e86\u89e3\u5065\u5eb7\u5b55\u5987\u4e2d\u80ce\u76d8\u6536\u7f29\u7684\u53d1\u751f\u9891\u7387\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u5355\u4e2d\u5fc3\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u89c2\u5bdf\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u62db\u52df36\u540d\u5065\u5eb7\u5b55\u5987\u572829-42\u5468\u5b55\u671f\u8fdb\u884cMRI\u626b\u63cf\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u547c\u5438\u89e6\u53d1\u3001\u591a\u5c42\u5355\u6b21\u68af\u5ea6\u56de\u6ce2\u5e73\u9762\u6210\u50cf\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u6709\u5b8c\u6210MRI\u626b\u63cf\u7684\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u5747\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u53ef\u89c1\u6536\u7f29\u3002\u80ce\u76d8\u6536\u7f29\u6bd4\u5b50\u5bab\u6536\u7f29\u66f4\u9891\u7e41(p=0.0061)\uff0c\u4e0e\u5b50\u5bab\u58c1\u8868\u9762\u79ef\u589e\u52a0(p=0.0015)\u3001\u80ce\u76d8\u7403\u5f62\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0(p<0.0001)\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u66f4\u957f(p=0.0151)\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u80ce\u76d8\u6536\u7f29\u5bfc\u81f4\u80ce\u76d8R2*\u53c2\u6570\u589e\u52a0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u81f3\u5c1160%\u7684\u5065\u5eb7\u5b55\u5987\u4e2d\u53d1\u751f\u80ce\u76d8\u6536\u7f29\uff0c\u4e2d\u4f4d\u9891\u7387\u4e3a\u6bcf\u5c0f\u65f62\u6b21\uff0c\u4e2d\u4f4d\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u4e3a2.4\u5206\u949f\uff0c\u6536\u7f29\u7279\u5f81\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u5b55\u5468\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u65e0\u660e\u663e\u53d8\u5316\u3002"}}

Unlike Gd, Mn is an endogenous paramagnetic metal with known biochemical pathways in the human body for excretion and metal regulation, which may alleviate the raised concerns about the safety of existing GBCAs. The aim of this study was to investigate the distribution, kinetics and image enhancement properties of a class of novel Mn-based macrocyclic chelates in a porcine model. Methods: Macrocyclic MBCAs, AH114608, GEH300017 and GEH200486, were tested and compared to gadoterate meglumine. Twelve female adult pigs were divided into four groups (n=3 for each CA). At 3 T MRI, T1 relaxometry analysis were measured longitudinally in multiple organs at five timepoints 30 minutes apart. CA kinetics was estimated from analysis of plasma CA concentrations by ICP-OES. Results: All four CAs exhibited T1-enhancing properties in the blood pool with GEH200486 having the largest increase in T1 relaxation rate (R1), GEH300017 and gadoterate meglumine having similar R1 increase and AH114608 a lower peak R1 change. A persistent increase in liver, kidney and myocardium R1 was observed with AH114608. To a lesser extent, a persistent increase of liver enhancement was also observed in T1-weighted images for GEH300017 and GEH200486 compared to gadoterate meglumine. All four CAs had similar bi-exponential plasma kinetics characterized by a rapid distribution phase and a slower elimination phase. Discussion: We have identified MBCA candidates with predominantly renal clearance and comparable efficacy in terms of vascular T1 relaxation, and comparable to the reference GBCA. The T1-enhancing properties of these novel Mn macrocyclic CAs can be used with routine clinical protocols and could be potentially utilised as an alternative to GBCAs for contrast-enhanced MRI procedures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u732a\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u9530\u57fa\u5927\u73af\u87af\u5408\u7269\uff08AH114608\u3001GEH300017\u3001GEH200486\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3aMRI\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5242\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u3001\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u589e\u5f3a\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u9486\u7279\u9178\u8461\u7532\u80fa\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9530\u57fa\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5242\u5177\u6709\u4e0e\u53c2\u8003\u9486\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5242\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u8840\u7ba1T1\u5f1b\u8c6b\u6548\u679c\u548c\u80be\u810f\u6e05\u9664\u7279\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u9486\u57fa\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5242\u5b58\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u62c5\u5fe7\uff0c\u800c\u9530\u662f\u4eba\u4f53\u5185\u6e90\u6027\u987a\u78c1\u6027\u91d1\u5c5e\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5df2\u77e5\u7684\u6392\u6cc4\u548c\u91d1\u5c5e\u8c03\u8282\u751f\u5316\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u7f13\u89e3\u73b0\u6709\u9486\u57fa\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5242\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u57283T MRI\u4e0b\uff0c\u5bf912\u53ea\u6210\u5e74\u96cc\u6027\u732a\uff08\u6bcf\u7ec43\u53ea\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u7eb5\u5411T1\u5f1b\u8c6b\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\uff08\u95f4\u969430\u5206\u949f\uff09\u6d4b\u91cf\u591a\u4e2a\u5668\u5b98\u7684T1\u5f1b\u8c6b\u503c\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7ICP-OES\u5206\u6790\u8840\u6d46\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5242\u6d53\u5ea6\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u6709\u56db\u79cd\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5242\u5728\u8840\u6c60\u4e2d\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51faT1\u589e\u5f3a\u7279\u6027\uff0cGEH200486\u7684T1\u5f1b\u8c6b\u7387\u589e\u52a0\u6700\u5927\u3002AH114608\u5728\u809d\u810f\u3001\u80be\u810f\u548c\u5fc3\u808c\u4e2d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u6301\u7eed\u7684R1\u589e\u52a0\u3002\u6240\u6709\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5242\u90fd\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u53cc\u6307\u6570\u8840\u6d46\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5feb\u901f\u5206\u5e03\u76f8\u548c\u8f83\u6162\u7684\u6d88\u9664\u76f8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b0\u578b\u9530\u57fa\u5927\u73af\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5242\u5177\u6709\u4e3b\u8981\u80be\u810f\u6e05\u9664\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u8840\u7ba1T1\u5f1b\u8c6b\u65b9\u9762\u4e0e\u53c2\u8003\u9486\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5242\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u5e38\u89c4\u4e34\u5e8a\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9486\u57fa\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5242\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u54c1\u7528\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u589e\u5f3aMRI\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002"}}

Scintillation imaging dosimetry shows potential to address several of these limitations. Here, translation to conventional photon external beam radiotherapy was examined using a novel wide-area imaging and sensing technique.\n  Methods: A modular scintillator array was combined with a dual-camera stereovision system for 3D localization and a clinical Cherenkov imaging system for optical scintillation detection. Water equivalent thickness, dose linearity, repetition rate stability, and angular dependence were characterized. Field edge detection was evaluated against radiochromic film using gamma analysis. System reproducibility was tested with consecutive deliveries simulating contralateral breast monitoring during whole-breast tangential radiotherapy.\n  Results: The array showed high dose linearity across the tested range, minimal beam perturbation, and consistent response within 5% across all available LINAC repetition rates. Dose-normalized scintillation varied within 5% over clinically relevant gantry angles, and camera angle corrections compensated for non-Lambertian emission. Field edge detection agreed closely with film, with a 99.98% gamma pass rate (3%/3 mm). Inter-delivery reproducibility of +/-1 cGy demonstrated robust system performance.\n  Conclusion: The conformable scintillator array imaging system provides spatially resolved, dynamic surface dosimetry with minimal workflow impact. Its ability to generate continuous dose maps across complex anatomical surfaces, while maintaining angular correction, addresses key limitations of current in vivo dosimetry and shows strong potential for clinical integration where wide-area surface dosimetry is required.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u5bbd\u533a\u57df\u95ea\u70c1\u6210\u50cf\u5242\u91cf\u6d4b\u5b9a\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u95ea\u70c1\u4f53\u9635\u5217\u3001\u7acb\u4f53\u89c6\u89c9\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u5207\u4f26\u79d1\u592b\u6210\u50cf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5149\u5b50\u5916\u7167\u5c04\u653e\u7597\u7684\u4f53\u5185\u5242\u91cf\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5728\u5242\u91cf\u7ebf\u6027\u3001\u89d2\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u548c\u573a\u8fb9\u7f18\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u5f02\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4f53\u5185\u5242\u91cf\u6d4b\u5b9a\u6280\u672f\u5728\u65f6\u7a7a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u548c\u975e\u5747\u5300\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u8fde\u7eed\u5242\u91cf\u6620\u5c04\u4e14\u5bf9\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u5f71\u54cd\u6700\u5c0f\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u5242\u91cf\u6d4b\u5b9a\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u95ea\u70c1\u4f53\u9635\u5217\u4e0e\u53cc\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u7acb\u4f53\u89c6\u89c9\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c3D\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e34\u5e8a\u5207\u4f26\u79d1\u592b\u6210\u50cf\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u5149\u5b66\u95ea\u70c1\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u6c34\u7b49\u6548\u539a\u5ea6\u3001\u5242\u91cf\u7ebf\u6027\u3001\u91cd\u590d\u7387\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u89d2\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u7b49\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u663e\u793a\u9ad8\u5242\u91cf\u7ebf\u6027\uff0c\u6700\u5c0f\u675f\u6d41\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u53ef\u7528LINAC\u91cd\u590d\u7387\u4e0b\u54cd\u5e94\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u57285%\u4ee5\u5185\uff0c\u573a\u8fb9\u7f18\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u80f6\u7247\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff0899.98%\u4f3d\u9a6c\u901a\u8fc7\u7387\uff09\uff0c\u4ea4\u4ed8\u95f4\u91cd\u73b0\u6027\u4e3a\u00b11 cGy\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u987a\u5e94\u6027\u95ea\u70c1\u4f53\u9635\u5217\u6210\u50cf\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8868\u9762\u5242\u91cf\u6d4b\u5b9a\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u590d\u6742\u89e3\u5256\u8868\u9762\u4e0a\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u5242\u91cf\u56fe\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u89d2\u5ea6\u6821\u6b63\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u4f53\u5185\u5242\u91cf\u6d4b\u5b9a\u7684\u5173\u952e\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u4e34\u5e8a\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, the 3D nature of the procedure and poor image contrast of the needle in heterogeneous tissue or at steep insertion angles often leads to confusion over the true location of the tip relative to the ultrasound imaging plane. This leads services to rely ionising, slow and expensive X-ray computed tomography guidance and/or senior clinicians for risky or otherwise challenging procedures. Existing methods to enhance needle visibility largely remain limited to 2D, and do not offer real-time volumetric guidance. Our proposed system provides the clinician with a real-time, quantitative visualisation of the 3D location of the needle tip superimposed onto B-mode ultrasound images. The tip location is determined from the time-of-flight of ultrasound generated by a photoacoustic beacon embedded in the needle bevel and received by a sparse receiver array distributed around the imaging system's curvilinear ultrasound probe. The performance of the system was assessed both in water and in an ex vivo tissue phantom, with referenced positions derived from X-ray computed tomography. The usability of the system was assessed by 12 clinicians performing simulated biopsies on a second ex vivo tissue phantom.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ecb\u5165\u8d85\u58f0\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c3D\u8ddf\u8e2a\u548cB\u6a21\u5f0f\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b0\u578b\u53ef\u8ddf\u8e2a\u9488\u82af\u6d3b\u68c0\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5149\u58f0\u4fe1\u6807\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u63a5\u6536\u5668\u9635\u5217\u5b9e\u65f6\u786e\u5b9a\u9488\u5c16\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4ecb\u5165\u653e\u5c04\u5b66\u624b\u672f\u4e2d\u9488\u5c16\u5b9a\u4f4d\u56f0\u96be\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4f9d\u8d56\u7535\u79bb\u8f90\u5c04\u7684CT\u5f15\u5bfc\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u91cd\u590d\u624b\u672f\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5d4c\u5165\u9488\u5c16\u7684\u5149\u58f0\u4fe1\u6807\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5728\u8d85\u58f0\u63a2\u5934\u5468\u56f4\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u63a5\u6536\u5668\u9635\u5217\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8d85\u58f0\u98de\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u786e\u5b9a\u9488\u5c163D\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5e76\u53e0\u52a0\u5230B\u6a21\u5f0f\u8d85\u58f0\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6c34\u548c\u79bb\u4f53\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\uff0c12\u540d\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u6d3b\u68c0\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u3001\u5b9a\u91cf\u7684\u9488\u5c163D\u4f4d\u7f6e\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u6539\u5584\u4ecb\u5165\u8d85\u58f0\u624b\u672f\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002"}}

Most current data is obtained via human teleoperation, which is expensive and difficult to scale. Reinforcement learning (RL) methods learn useful skills through autonomous exploration, making them a viable approach for generating data. However, standard RL training collapses to a narrow execution pattern, limiting its utility for large-scale pre-training. We propose Discover, Lea rn and Reinforce (DLR), an information-theoretic pattern discovery framework that generates multiple distinct, high-success behavioral patterns for VLA pretraining. Empirically, DLR generates a markedly more diverse trajectory corpus on LIBERO. Specifically, it learns multiple distinct, high-success strategies for the same task where standard RL discovers only one, and hence it covers substantially broader regions of the state-action space. When adapted to unseen downstream task suites, VLA models pretrained on our diverse RL data surpass counterparts trained on equal-sized standard RL datasets. Moreover, DLR exhibits positive data-scaling behavior that single-pattern RL lacks. These results position multi-pattern RL as a practical, scalable data engine for embodied foundation models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86DLR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u6a21\u5f0f\u53d1\u73b0\u751f\u6210\u591a\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u9ad8\u6210\u529f\u7387\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u591a\u6837\u5316\u3001\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u4eba\u5de5\u8fdc\u7a0b\u64cd\u4f5c\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u3002\u6807\u51c6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u4e3b\u63a2\u7d22\u5b66\u4e60\u6709\u7528\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u6536\u655b\u5230\u5355\u4e00\u6267\u884c\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Discover\u3001Learn\u548cReinforce\uff08DLR\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u591a\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u9ad8\u6210\u529f\u7387\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5728LIBERO\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cDLR\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u660e\u663e\u66f4\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff0c\u4e3a\u540c\u4e00\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u591a\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u9ad8\u6210\u529f\u7387\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u800c\u6807\u51c6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u53ea\u80fd\u53d1\u73b0\u4e00\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u3002DLR\u8986\u76d6\u4e86\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u72b6\u6001-\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u5957\u4ef6\u4e0a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528DLR\u591a\u6837\u5316RL\u6570\u636e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684VLA\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7528\u540c\u7b49\u89c4\u6a21\u6807\u51c6RL\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5bf9\u5e94\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "DLR\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u79ef\u6781\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6269\u5c55\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u800c\u5355\u6a21\u5f0f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8fd9\u79cd\u7279\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u5c06\u591a\u6a21\u5f0f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e3a\u5177\u8eab\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6570\u636e\u5f15\u64ce\u3002"}}

Rather than fine tune these models (for example MedSAM), we propose a compositional alternative where the foundation model output is treated as an additional input channel and passed alongside the MRI to highlight regions of interest.\n  We generate SAM-2 prompts by using a lightweight 3D U-Net that was previously trained on MRI segmentation. The U-Net may have been trained on a different dataset, so its guesses are often imprecise but usually in the correct region. The edges of the resulting foundation model guesses are smoothed to improve alignment with the MRI. We also test prompt free segmentation using DINO attention maps in the same framework.\n  This has-a architecture avoids modifying foundation weights and adapts to domain shift without retraining the foundation model.

Large language models (LLMs) offer promise in generating draft responses for clinicians, yet how physicians refine these drafts remains underexplored. We present a mixed-methods study with nine ophthalmologists answering 144 cataract surgery questions across three conditions: writing from scratch, directly editing LLM drafts, and instruction-based indirect editing. Our quantitative and qualitative analyses reveal that while LLM outputs were generally accurate, occasional errors and automation bias revealed the need for human oversight.

In this work, we present PIGReward, a personalized reward model that dynamically generates user-conditioned evaluation dimensions and assesses images through CoT reasoning. To address the scarcity of user data, PIGReward adopt a self-bootstrapping strategy that reasons over limited reference data to construct rich user contexts, enabling personalization without user-specific training. Beyond evaluation, PIGReward provides personalized feedback that drives user-specific prompt optimization, improving alignment between generated images and individual intent. We further introduce PIGBench, a per-user preference benchmark capturing diverse visual interpretations of shared prompts.

The messy, real-world data encountered during deployment (e.g. occluded or multilingual text) remains massively underrepresented in existing corpora. Robots, as embodied agents, are uniquely positioned to close this gap: they can act in physical environments to collect large-scale, real-world data that enriches FM training with precisely the examples current models lack. We introduce the Robot-Powered Data Flywheel, a framework that transforms robots from FM consumers into data generators. By deploying robots equipped with FMs in the wild, we enable a virtuous cycle: robots perform useful tasks while collecting real-world data that improves both domain-specific adaptation and domain-adjacent generalization. We instantiate this framework with Scanford, a mobile manipulator deployed in the East Asia Library for 2 weeks. Scanford autonomously scans shelves, identifies books using a vision-language model (VLM), and leverages the library catalog to label images without human annotation. This deployment both aids librarians and produces a dataset to finetune the underlying VLM, improving performance on the domain-specific in-the-wild library setting and on domain-adjacent multilingual OCR benchmarks. Using data collected from 2103 shelves, Scanford improves VLM performance on book identification from 32.0% to 71.8% and boosts domain-adjacent multilingual OCR from 24.8% to 46.6% (English) and 30.8% to 38.0% (Chinese), while saving an ~18.7 hrs of human time. These results highlight how robot-powered data flywheels can both reduce human effort in real deployments and unlock new pathways for continually adapting FMs to the messiness of reality.

Though the influence function was proposed for attributing how infinitesimal up-weighting or removal of individual training examples affects model outputs, its implementation is still challenging in deep-learning vision models: inverse-curvature computations are expensive, and training non-stationarity invalidates static approximations. Prior works use iterative solvers and low-rank surrogates to reduce cost, but offline computation lags behind training dynamics, and missing confidence calibration yields fragile rankings that misidentify critical examples. To address these challenges, we introduce a Stability-Guided Online Influence Framework (SG-OIF), the first framework that treats algorithmic stability as a real-time controller, which (i) maintains lightweight anchor IHVPs via stochastic Richardson and preconditioned Neumann; (ii) proposes modular curvature backends to modulate per-example influence scores using stability-guided residual thresholds, anomaly gating, and confidence. Experimental results show that SG-OIF achieves SOTA (State-Of-The-Art) on noise-label and out-of-distribution detection tasks across multiple datasets with various corruption. Notably, our approach achieves 91.1\\% accuracy in the top 1\\% prediction samples on the CIFAR-10 (20\\% asym), and gets 99.8\\% AUPR score on MNIST, effectively demonstrating that this framework is a practical controller for online influence estimation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSG-OIF\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b97\u6cd5\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u5f71\u54cd\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u6807\u7b7e\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u70b9\u5bf9\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u4f30\u8ba1\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9762\u4e34\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u3001\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6821\u51c6\u7f3a\u5931\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "SG-OIF\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u7b97\u6cd5\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u7ef4\u62a4\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u951a\u70b9IHVPs\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u66f2\u7387\u540e\u7aef\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u9608\u503c\u3001\u5f02\u5e38\u95e8\u63a7\u548c\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6765\u8c03\u8282\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5206\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR-10\uff0820%\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u566a\u58f0\uff09\u4e0a\uff0c\u524d1%\u9884\u6d4b\u6837\u672c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe\u523091.1%\uff1b\u5728MNIST\u4e0aAUPR\u5f97\u5206\u8fbe\u523099.8%\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5404\u79cd\u635f\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "SG-OIF\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5c06\u7b97\u6cd5\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u5f71\u54cd\u4f30\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u6df1\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u4f30\u8ba1\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u3002"}}

To this end, it is valuable to define a rotation-invariant representation of images, retaining all information about that image, but disregarding the way an object is rotated in the frame. To be practical for learning tasks, this representation must be computationally efficient for large datasets and invertible, so the representation can be visualized in image space. To this end, we present the selective disk bispectrum: a fast, rotation-invariant representation for image shape analysis. While the translational bispectrum has long been used as a translational invariant representation for 1-D and 2-D signals, its extension to 2-D (disk) rotational invariance on images has been hindered by the absence of an invertible formulation and its cubic complexity. In this work, we derive an explicit inverse for the disk bispectrum, which allows us to define a \"selective\" disk bispectrum, which only uses the minimal number of coefficients needed for faithful shape recovery. We show that this representation enables multi-reference alignment for rotated images-a task previously intractable for disk bispectrum methods.

Meanwhile, the community is increasingly moving toward Video Anomaly Understanding (VAU), which requires deeper semantic and causal reasoning but remains difficult to benchmark due to the heavy manual annotation effort it demands. In this paper, we introduce Pistachio, a new VAD/VAU benchmark constructed entirely through a controlled, generation-based pipeline. By leveraging recent advances in video generation models, Pistachio provides precise control over scenes, anomaly types, and temporal narratives, effectively eliminating the biases and limitations of Internet-collected datasets. Our pipeline integrates scene-conditioned anomaly assignment, multi-step storyline generation, and a temporally consistent long-form synthesis strategy that produces coherent 41-second videos with minimal human intervention.

Despite their shared objective, existing approaches often tackle these tasks using specialized architectures or modality-specific parameters, limiting their generalization and scalability. Recent efforts have attempted to unify multiple tracking and segmentation subtasks from the perspectives of any modality input or multi-task inference. However, these approaches tend to overlook two critical challenges: the distributional gap across different modalities and the feature representation gap across tasks. These issues hinder effective cross-task and cross-modal knowledge sharing, ultimately constraining the development of a true generalist model. To address these limitations, we propose a universal tracking and segmentation framework named SATA, which unifies a broad spectrum of tracking and segmentation subtasks with any modality input. Specifically, a Decoupled Mixture-of-Expert (DeMoE) mechanism is presented to decouple the unified representation learning task into the modeling process of cross-modal shared knowledge and specific information, thus enabling the model to maintain flexibility while enhancing generalization. Additionally, we introduce a Task-aware Multi-object Tracking (TaMOT) pipeline to unify all the task outputs as a unified set of instances with calibrated ID information, thereby alleviating the degradation of task-specific knowledge during multi-task training.

Most of the standard vehicles follow the Ackermann style steering mechanism. This has become to de facto standard for large and long faring vehicles. The local planner of an autonomous vehicle controls the low-level vehicle movement upon which the vehicle will perform its motor actuation. In our work, we focus on autonomous vehicles in road and perform experiments to analyze the effect of low-level controllers in the simulation and a real environment. To increase the precision and stability of trajectory tracking in autonomous cars, a novel method that combines lane identification with Model Predictive Control (MPC) is presented. The research focuses on camera-equipped autonomous vehicles and uses methods like edge recognition, sliding window-based straight-line identification for lane line extraction, and dynamic region of interest (ROI) extraction.

A single-lane road simulation model is built using ROS Gazebo and tested in order to verify the controller's performance.

The relative orientation of a 3D reference object can be determined from a 3D rotated version of that object, or from a projection of the rotated object to a 2D planar image. This projection can be a perspective projection (the PnP problem) or an orthographic projection (the OnP problem). We restrict our attention here to the OnP problem and the full 3D pose estimation task (the EnP problem). Here we solve the least squares systems for both the error-free EnP and OnP problems in terms of the determinant ratio matrix (DRaM) approach. The noisy-data case can be addressed with a straightforward rotation correction scheme. While the SVD and optimal quaternion eigensystem methods solve the noisy EnP 3D-3D alignment exactly, the noisy 3D-2D orthographic (OnP) task has no known comparable closed form, and can be solved by DRaM-class methods. We note that while previous similar work has been presented in the literature exploiting both the QR decomposition and the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse transformations, here we place these methods in a larger context that has not previously been fully recognized in the absence of the corresponding DRaM solution. We term this class of solutions as the DRaM family, and conduct comparisons of the behavior of the families of solutions for the EnP and OnP rotation estimation problems. Overall, this work presents both a new solution to the 3D and 2D orthographic pose estimation problems and provides valuable insight into these classes of problems. With hindsight, we are able to show that our DRaM solutions to the exact EnP and OnP problems possess derivations that could have been discovered in the time of Gauss, and in fact generalize to all analogous N-dimensional Euclidean pose estimation problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u884c\u5217\u5f0f\u6bd4\u503c\u77e9\u9635\uff08DRaM\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b33D-3D\uff08EnP\uff09\u548c3D-2D\u6b63\u4ea4\u6295\u5f71\uff08OnP\uff09\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c06\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7edf\u4e00\u5230DRaM\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u6240\u6709N\u7ef4\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u662f\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982SVD\u548c\u6700\u4f18\u56db\u5143\u6570\u7279\u5f81\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u7cbe\u786e\u89e3\u51b3\u542b\u566a\u58f0\u76843D-3D\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4e8e\u542b\u566a\u58f0\u76843D-2D\u6b63\u4ea4\u6295\u5f71\u4efb\u52a1\u5c1a\u65e0\u7c7b\u4f3c\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u884c\u5217\u5f0f\u6bd4\u503c\u77e9\u9635\uff08DRaM\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\u65e0\u8bef\u5deeEnP\u548cOnP\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u542b\u566a\u58f0\u60c5\u51b5\u91c7\u7528\u76f4\u63a5\u65cb\u8f6c\u6821\u6b63\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u5c06QR\u5206\u89e3\u548cMoore-Penrose\u4f2a\u9006\u53d8\u6362\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u7edf\u4e00\u5230DRaM\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86EnP\u548cOnP\u65cb\u8f6c\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\u7684DRaM\u5bb6\u65cf\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u6790\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u65cf\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u6240\u6709N\u7ef4\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4e3a3D\u548c2D\u6b63\u4ea4\u6295\u5f71\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u8fd8\u6df1\u5165\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8fd9\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u672c\u8d28\u7279\u6027\u3002DRaM\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u5230\u9ad8\u65af\u65f6\u4ee3\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

This study explores human-robot interactions during handover tasks using Virtual Reality (VR) to investigate differences in human motor performance across various task dynamics and robot kinematics. A VR-based robot handover simulation afforded safe and controlled assessments of human-robot interactions. In separate experiments, four potential influences on human performance were examined (1) control over task initiation and robot movement synchrony (temporal and spatiotemporal); (2) partner appearance (human versus robotic); (3) robot velocity profiles (minimum jerk, constant velocity, constant acceleration, and biphasic); and (4) the timing of rotational object motion. Findings across experiments emphasize humans benefit from robots providing early and salient visual information about task-relevant object motion, and advantages of human-like smooth robot trajectories. To varying degrees, these manipulations improved predictive accuracy and synchronization during interaction.

We introduce the Eyelid Angle (ELA), a novel, reproducible metric of eye openness derived from 3D facial landmarks. Unlike conventional binary eye state estimators or 2D measures, such as the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR), the ELA provides a stable geometric description of eyelid motion that is robust to variations in camera angle. Using the ELA, we design a blink detection framework that extracts temporal characteristics, including the closing, closed, and reopening durations, which are shown to correlate with drowsiness levels. To address the scarcity and risk of collecting natural drowsiness data, we further leverage ELA signals to animate rigged avatars in Blender 3D, enabling the creation of realistic synthetic datasets with controllable noise, camera viewpoints, and blink dynamics. Experimental results in public driver monitoring datasets demonstrate that the ELA offers lower variance under viewpoint changes compared to EAR and achieves accurate blink detection.

Inspired by the Minimum Description Length principle, we reinterpret image tokens as vectors in a visual semantic space and define the intrinsic semantic complexity of an image as the smallest set of basis vectors needed to span this space.

To address these challenges, we propose a Vision-Integrated Trajectory Alignment (VITA) framework that learns a shared discrete latent space for vision and action, enabling joint modeling of perception and motor control.

GroundingAgent employs a structured, iterative reasoning mechanism that integrates pretrained open-vocabulary object detectors, multimodal large language models (MLLMs), and large language models (LLMs) to progressively refine candidate regions through joint semantic and spatial analyses. Remarkably, GroundingAgent achieves an average zero-shot grounding accuracy of 65.1 % on widely-used benchmarks (RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg), entirely without fine-tuning. Furthermore, by substituting MLLM-generated captions with the original query texts, the accuracy at the selection stage alone reaches approximately 90 %, closely matching supervised performance and underscoring the critical role of LLM reasoning capabilities.

Existing compression methods often rely on heuristic importance metrics or empirical pruning rules, lacking theoretical guarantees about information preservation. In this work, we propose InfoPrune, an information-theoretic framework for adaptive structural compression of VLMs. Grounded in the Information Bottleneck principle, we formulate pruning as a trade-off between retaining task-relevant semantics and discarding redundant dependencies. To quantify the contribution of each attention head, we introduce an entropy-based effective rank (eRank) and employ the Kolmogorov--Smirnov (KS) distance to measure the divergence between original and compressed structures. This yields a unified criterion that jointly considers structural sparsity and informational efficiency. Building on this foundation, we further design two complementary schemes: (1) a training-based head pruning guided by the proposed information loss objective, and (2) a training-free FFN compression via adaptive low-rank approximation. Extensive experiments on VQAv2, TextVQA, and GQA demonstrate that InfoPrune achieves up to 3.2x FLOP reduction and 1.8x acceleration with negligible performance degradation, establishing a theoretically grounded and practically effective step toward efficient multimodal large models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86InfoPrune\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7ed3\u6784\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u526a\u679d\u548cFFN\u4f4e\u79e9\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u538b\u7f29\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0d\u65ad\u589e\u957f\u5e26\u6765\u90e8\u7f72\u548c\u6548\u7387\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u7559\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u71b5\u57fa\u6709\u6548\u79e9\u548cKS\u8ddd\u79bb\u91cf\u5316\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f0f\u5934\u526a\u679d\u548c\u514d\u8bad\u7ec3FFN\u538b\u7f29\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u5728VQAv2\u3001TextVQA\u548cGQA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b03.2\u500dFLOP\u51cf\u5c11\u548c1.8\u500d\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "InfoPrune\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6709\u6548\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Recent approaches have shifted from focusing solely on common scenarios to addressing complex, long-tail situations such as subtle human behaviors, traffic accidents, and non-compliant driving patterns. Given the demonstrated capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in understanding visual and natural language inputs and following instructions, recent methods have integrated LLMs into autonomous driving systems to enhance reasoning, interpretability, and performance across diverse scenarios. However, existing methods typically rely either on real-world data, which is suitable for industrial deployment, or on simulation data tailored to rare or hard case scenarios. Few approaches effectively integrate the complementary advantages of both data sources. To address this limitation, we propose a novel VLM-guided, end-to-end adversarial transfer framework for autonomous driving that transfers long-tail handling capabilities from simulation to real-world deployment, named CoC-VLA. The framework comprises a teacher VLM model, a student VLM model, and a discriminator. Both the teacher and student VLM models utilize a shared base architecture, termed the Chain-of-Causality Visual-Language Model (CoC VLM), which integrates temporal information via an end-to-end text adapter. This architecture supports chain-of-thought reasoning to infer complex driving logic. The teacher and student VLM models are pre-trained separately on simulated and real-world datasets.

Existing approaches typically model it as a discrete and static process, while real-world applications involve continuous gravity-driven interactions. This idealized simplification leads to infeasible deployments (e.g., unstable packing) in practice. Simulations with physical engine offer an opportunity to emulate continuous gravity effects, enabling the training of reinforcement learning (RL) agents to address such limitations and improve packing stability. However, a simulation-to-reality gap persists due to dynamic variations in physical properties of real-world objects, such as various friction coefficients, elasticity, and non-uniform weight distributions. To bridge this gap, we propose a hybrid RL framework that collaborates with physical simulation with real-world data feedback. Firstly, domain randomization is applied during simulation to expose agents to a spectrum of physical parameters, enhancing their generalization capability. Secondly, the RL agent is fine-tuned with real-world deployment feedback, further reducing collapse rates.

However, most of them adopt static and non-learnable tool invocation mechanisms, which limit the discovery of diverse clues essential for robust perception and reasoning regarding temporally or spatially complex videos. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Multi-agent system for video understanding, namely VideoChat-M1. Instead of using a single or fixed policy, VideoChat-M1 adopts a distinct Collaborative Policy Planning (CPP) paradigm with multiple policy agents, which comprises three key processes. (1) Policy Generation: Each agent generates its unique tool invocation policy tailored to the user's query; (2) Policy Execution: Each agent sequentially invokes relevant tools to execute its policy and explore the video content; (3) Policy Communication: During the intermediate stages of policy execution, agents interact with one another to update their respective policies. Through this collaborative framework, all agents work in tandem, dynamically refining their preferred policies based on contextual insights from peers to effectively respond to the user's query. Moreover, we equip our CPP paradigm with a concise Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) method. Consequently, the team of policy agents can be jointly optimized to enhance VideoChat-M1's performance, guided by both the final answer reward and intermediate collaborative process feedback. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VideoChat-M1 achieves SOTA performance across eight benchmarks spanning four tasks.

Six- axis force-torque sensors are commonly used to obtain contact feedback, but their high cost and fragility have discouraged many researchers from adopting them in contact-rich tasks. To offer a more cost-efficient and easy-accessible source of contact feedback, we present ShapeForce, a low-cost, plug-and-play soft wrist that provides force-like signals for contact-rich robotic manipulation. Inspired by how humans rely on relative force changes in contact rather than precise force magnitudes, ShapeForce converts external force and torque into measurable deformations of its compliant core, which are then estimated via marker-based pose tracking and converted into force-like signals. Our design eliminates the need for calibration or specialized electronics to obtain exact values, and instead focuses on capturing force and torque changes sufficient for enabling contact-rich manipulation.

While this form of reasoning is fundamental to human cognition, current vision-language benchmarks lack comprehensive evaluation of this ability and instead focus on surface-level recognition or image-text alignment.\n  To address this gap, we introduce Perceptual Taxonomy, a benchmark for physically grounded visual reasoning. We annotate 3173 objects with four property families covering 84 fine-grained attributes. Using these annotations, we construct a multiple-choice question benchmark with 5802 images across both synthetic and real domains. The benchmark contains 28033 template-based questions spanning four types (object description, spatial reasoning, property matching, and taxonomy reasoning), along with 50 expert-crafted questions designed to evaluate models across the full spectrum of perceptual taxonomy reasoning.\n  Experimental results show that leading vision-language models perform well on recognition tasks but degrade by 10 to 20 percent on property-driven questions, especially those requiring multi-step reasoning over structured attributes. These findings highlight a persistent gap in structured visual understanding and the limitations of current models that rely heavily on pattern matching. We also show that providing in-context reasoning examples from simulated scenes improves performance on real-world and expert-curated questions, demonstrating the effectiveness of perceptual-taxonomy-guided prompting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff08Perceptual Taxonomy\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9700\u8981\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5c5e\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0b\u964d10-20%\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u8868\u9762\u7ea7\u8bc6\u522b\u6216\u56fe\u50cf\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u8fd9\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e2d\u7684\u8fd9\u79cd\u63a8\u7406\u5f62\u5f0f\u662f\u57fa\u7840\u6027\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u6807\u6ce8\u4e863173\u4e2a\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u56db\u4e2a\u5c5e\u6027\u65cf\uff0c\u6db5\u76d684\u4e2a\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5c5e\u6027\u3002\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b5802\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u591a\u9009\u9898\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec28033\u4e2a\u6a21\u677f\u95ee\u9898\u548c50\u4e2a\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u56db\u79cd\u7c7b\u578b\uff1a\u5bf9\u8c61\u63cf\u8ff0\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u5c5e\u6027\u5339\u914d\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u9886\u5148\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5c5e\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d10-20%\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9700\u8981\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5c5e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u793a\u4f8b\u53ef\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u7b56\u5212\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u6a21\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\u3002\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u7a81\u663e\u4e86\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

We introduce a hybrid implicit-explicit representation that fuses neural fields with Gaussian primitives to jointly capture global structural priors and locally observed details. Based on this hybrid state, we derive a hierarchical uncertainty volume that quantifies both implicit global structure quality and explicit local surface confidence. To focus optimization on the most informative regions, we propose an uncertainty-driven keyframe selection strategy that anchors high-entropy viewpoints as sparse attention nodes, coupled with a viewpoint-space sliding window for uncertainty-aware local refinement. The planning module formulates next-best-view selection as an Expected Hybrid Information Gain problem and incorporates a risk-sensitive path planner to ensure efficient and safe exploration. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, completeness, and rendering quality, highlighting its effectiveness for real-world active reconstruction and robotic perception tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f3D\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a2\u7d22\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u7ea7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u6765\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f73\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u76843D\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u6355\u6349\u5168\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u9690\u5f0f-\u663e\u5f0f\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u795e\u7ecf\u573a\u548c\u9ad8\u65af\u57fa\u5143\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u5206\u5c42\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f53\u79ef\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u5c06\u6700\u4f73\u89c6\u89d2\u9009\u62e9\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u671f\u671b\u6df7\u5408\u4fe1\u606f\u589e\u76ca\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u548c\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e3b\u52a8\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Vidi models continue to evolve toward next-generation video creation and have achieved state-of-the-art performance in multimodal temporal retrieval (TR). In its second release, Vidi2 advances video understanding with fine-grained spatio-temporal grounding (STG) and extends its capability to video question answering (Video QA), enabling comprehensive multimodal reasoning. Given a text query, Vidi2 can identify not only the corresponding timestamps but also the bounding boxes of target objects within the output time ranges. This end-to-end spatio-temporal grounding capability enables potential applications in complex editing scenarios, such as plot or character understanding, automatic multi-view switching, and intelligent, composition-aware reframing and cropping. To enable comprehensive evaluation of STG in practical settings, we introduce a new benchmark, VUE-STG, which offers four key improvements over existing STG datasets: 1) Video duration: spans from roughly 10s to 30 mins, enabling long-context reasoning; 2) Query format: queries are mostly converted into noun phrases while preserving sentence-level expressiveness; 3) Annotation quality: all ground-truth time ranges and bounding boxes are manually annotated with high accuracy; 4) Evaluation metric: a refined vIoU/tIoU/vIoU-Intersection scheme. In addition, we upgrade the previous VUE-TR benchmark to VUE-TR-V2, achieving a more balanced video-length distribution and more user-style queries. Remarkably, the Vidi2 model substantially outperforms leading proprietary systems, such as Gemini 3 Pro (Preview) and GPT-5, on both VUE-TR-V2 and VUE-STG, while achieving competitive results with popular open-source models with similar scale on video QA benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Vidi2\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u91cd\u5927\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff08STG\uff09\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u95ee\u7b54\uff08Video QA\uff09\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u6587\u672c\u67e5\u8be2\u8bc6\u522b\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\u548c\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6VUE-STG\u548cVUE-TR-V2\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u9886\u5148\u7684\u4e13\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u9891\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u4e0a\u4e3b\u8981\u7684\u6c9f\u901a\u548c\u521b\u4f5c\u5a92\u4ecb\uff0c\u5bf9\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u4ea7\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u6765\u652f\u6301\u590d\u6742\u7f16\u8f91\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "Vidi2\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u6587\u672c\u67e5\u8be2\u8bc6\u522b\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u8303\u56f4\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u51c6VUE-STG\u548c\u5347\u7ea7\u7684VUE-TR-V2\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "Vidi2\u6a21\u578b\u5728VUE-TR-V2\u548cVUE-STG\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eGemini 3 Pro\u548cGPT-5\u7b49\u4e13\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u4e0e\u7c7b\u4f3c\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u53d6\u5f97\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "Vidi2\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u95ee\u7b54\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6280\u672f\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

A generic control framework is therefore essential, and a key obstacle lies in the persistent use of rigid-body control logic, which relies on precise models and strict low-level execution. Such a paradigm is effective for rigid robots but fails for soft robots, where the ability to tolerate and exploit approximate action representations, i.e., control compliance, is the basis of robustness and adaptability rather than a disturbance to be eliminated. Control should thus shift from suppressing compliance to explicitly exploiting it. Human motor control exemplifies this principle: instead of computing exact dynamics or issuing detailed muscle-level commands, it expresses intention through high-level movement tendencies, while reflexes and biomechanical mechanisms autonomously resolve local details. This architecture enables robustness, flexibility, and cross-task generalization. Motivated by this insight, we propose a generic soft-robot control framework grounded in control compliance and validate it across robots with diverse morphologies and actuation mechanisms. The results demonstrate stable, safe, and cross-platform transferable behavior, indicating that embracing control compliance, rather than resisting it, may provide a widely applicable foundation for unified soft-robot control.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a7\u5236\u67d4\u6027\u7684\u901a\u7528\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u6291\u5236\u8fd1\u4f3c\u52a8\u4f5c\u8868\u793a\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5f62\u6001\u548c\u9a71\u52a8\u673a\u5236\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0a\u7684\u8de8\u5e73\u53f0\u53ef\u8f6c\u79fb\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u788e\u7247\u5316\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u5f62\u6001\u548c\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6848\u9700\u8981\u7279\u5b9a\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u7406\u8bba\u6574\u5408\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u90e8\u7f72\u3002\u521a\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u903b\u8f91\u4f9d\u8d56\u7cbe\u786e\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e25\u683c\u4f4e\u7ea7\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u800c\u63a7\u5236\u67d4\u6027\u662f\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "\u501f\u9274\u4eba\u7c7b\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u5c42\u8fd0\u52a8\u503e\u5411\u8868\u8fbe\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u53cd\u5c04\u548c\u751f\u7269\u529b\u5b66\u673a\u5236\u81ea\u4e3b\u89e3\u51b3\u5c40\u90e8\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a7\u5236\u67d4\u6027\u7684\u901a\u7528\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u5f62\u6001\u548c\u9a71\u52a8\u673a\u5236\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u4e14\u8de8\u5e73\u53f0\u53ef\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u62e5\u62b1\u63a7\u5236\u67d4\u6027\u800c\u975e\u62b5\u6297\u5b83\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Heritage institutions worldwide have digitized more than one million maps, and automated techniques now enable large-scale recognition and extraction of map content. Yet these methods have engaged little with the history of cartography, or the view that maps are semantic-symbolic systems, and cultural objects reflecting political and epistemic expectations. This work leverages a diverse corpus of 771,561 map records and 99,715 digitized images aggregated from 38 digital catalogs. After normalization, the dataset includes 236,925 contributors and spans six centuries, from 1492 to 1948. These data make it possible to chart geographic structures and the global chronology of map publication. The spatial focus of cartography is analyzed in relation to political dynamics, evidencing links between Atlantic maritime charting, the triangular trade, and colonial expansion. Further results document the progression of national, domestic focus and the impact of military conflicts on publication volumes. The research introduces semantic segmentation techniques and object detection models for the generic recognition of land classes and cartographic signs, trained on annotated data and synthetic images. The analysis of land classes shows that maps are designed images whose framing and composition emphasize features through centering and semantic symmetries. The study of cartographic figuration encodes 63 M signs and 25 M fragments into a latent visual space, revealing figurative shifts such as the replacement of relief hachures by terrain contours and showing that signs tend to form locally consistent systems. Analyses of collaboration and diffusion highlight the role of legitimacy, larger actors, and major cities in the spread of figurative norms and semiotic cultures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5206\u6790\u5236\u56fe\u9057\u4ea7\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5229\u752877\u4e07\u591a\u6761\u5730\u56fe\u8bb0\u5f55\u548c\u8fd110\u4e07\u5f20\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4ece\u6587\u5316\u89c6\u89d2\u7814\u7a76\u5730\u56fe\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u7b26\u53f7\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u6f14\u53d8\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5730\u56fe\u5206\u6790\u6280\u672f\u5f88\u5c11\u4ece\u5236\u56fe\u53f2\u548c\u6587\u5316\u89c6\u89d2\u7814\u7a76\u5730\u56fe\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5730\u56fe\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53cd\u6620\u653f\u6cbb\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u671f\u671b\u7684\u6587\u5316\u5bf9\u8c61\u8fd9\u4e00\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6536\u96c6\u6765\u81ea38\u4e2a\u6570\u5b57\u76ee\u5f55\u7684771,561\u6761\u5730\u56fe\u8bb0\u5f55\u548c99,715\u5f20\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u6807\u51c6\u5316\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4e8e\u571f\u5730\u7c7b\u522b\u548c\u5236\u56fe\u7b26\u53f7\u7684\u901a\u7528\u8bc6\u522b\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u5730\u56fe\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u7126\u70b9\u3001\u6784\u56fe\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u7b26\u53f7\u6f14\u53d8\u3002", "result": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5236\u56fe\u7a7a\u95f4\u7126\u70b9\u4e0e\u653f\u6cbb\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u5982\u5927\u897f\u6d0b\u6d77\u56fe\u4e0e\u4e09\u89d2\u8d38\u6613\u3001\u6b96\u6c11\u6269\u5f20\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\uff1b\u53d1\u73b0\u5730\u56fe\u662f\u6709\u610f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c45\u4e2d\u548c\u5bf9\u79f0\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u7f16\u78016300\u4e07\u4e2a\u7b26\u53f7\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4ece\u9634\u5f71\u7ebf\u5230\u7b49\u9ad8\u7ebf\u7684\u56fe\u5f62\u6f14\u53d8\uff1b\u53d1\u73b0\u7b26\u53f7\u5f62\u6210\u5c40\u90e8\u4e00\u81f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5236\u56fe\u9057\u4ea7\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5730\u56fe\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6587\u5316\u4ea7\u54c1\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5408\u6cd5\u6027\u3001\u5927\u578b\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u548c\u4e3b\u8981\u57ce\u5e02\u5728\u4f20\u64ad\u56fe\u5f62\u89c4\u8303\u548c\u7b26\u53f7\u6587\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

We introduce Dynamic-ICP, a Doppler-aware registration framework. The method (i) estimates ego motion from per-point Doppler velocity via robust regression and builds a velocity filter, (ii) clusters dynamic objects and reconstructs object-wise translational velocities from ego-compensated radial measurements, (iii) predicts dynamic points with a constant-velocity model, and (iv) aligns scans using a compact objective that combines point-to-plane geometry residual with a translation-invariant, rotation-only Doppler residual. The approach requires no external sensors or sensor-vehicle calibration and operates directly on FMCW LiDAR range and Doppler velocities. We evaluate Dynamic-ICP on three datasets-HeRCULES, HeLiPR, AevaScenes-focusing on highly dynamic scenes. Dynamic-ICP consistently improves rotational stability and translation accuracy over the state-of-the-art methods. Our approach is also simple to integrate into existing pipelines, runs in real time, and provides a lightweight solution for robust registration in dynamic environments.

Recent AI-based frameworks have been developed to analyze large volumes of aerial imagery collected by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, providing actionable insights rapidly. However, creating and annotating data for training these models is costly and time-consuming, resulting in datasets that are limited in size and diversity. Furthermore, most existing approaches rely on traditional classification-based frameworks with fixed answer spaces, restricting their ability to provide new information without additional data collection or model retraining. Using pre-trained generative models built on in-context learning (ICL) allows for flexible and open-ended answer spaces. However, these models often generate hallucinated outputs or produce generic responses that lack domain-specific relevance. To address these limitations, we propose ThiFAN-VQA, a two-stage reasoning-based framework for visual question answering (VQA) in disaster scenarios. ThiFAN-VQA first generates structured reasoning traces using chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting and ICL to enable interpretable reasoning under limited supervision. A subsequent answer selection module evaluates the generated responses and assigns the most coherent and contextually accurate answer, effectively improve the model performance. By integrating a custom information retrieval system, domain-specific prompting, and reasoning-guided answer selection, ThiFAN-VQA bridges the gap between zero-shot and supervised methods, combining flexibility with consistency. Experiments on FloodNet and RescueNet-VQA, UAV-based datasets from flood- and hurricane-affected regions, demonstrate that ThiFAN-VQA achieves superior accuracy, interpretability, and adaptability for real-world post-disaster damage assessment tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86ThiFAN-VQA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u7136\u707e\u5bb3\u540e\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u9650\u76d1\u7763\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u7b54\u6848\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709AI\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u707e\u5bb3\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6709\u9650\u3001\u4f20\u7edf\u5206\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3001\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7b\u89c9\u6216\u901a\u7528\u56de\u7b54\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u7b54\u6848\u9009\u62e9\u6a21\u5757\u8bc4\u4f30\u751f\u6210\u54cd\u5e94\u5e76\u5206\u914d\u6700\u8fde\u8d2f\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "result": "\u5728FloodNet\u548cRescueNet-VQA\u4e24\u4e2a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cThiFAN-VQA\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u707e\u540e\u635f\u5bb3\u8bc4\u4f30\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "ThiFAN-VQA\u6210\u529f\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u548c\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5c06\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u4e0e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4e3a\u707e\u5bb3\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

The architecture comprises a Native Vision Transformer (ViT) and a lightweight LLM connected via an MLP adapter. HunyuanOCR demonstrates superior performance, outperforming commercial APIs, traditional pipelines, and larger models (e.g., Qwen3-VL-4B). Specifically, it surpasses current public solutions in perception tasks (Text Spotting, Parsing) and excels in semantic tasks (IE, Text Image Translation), securing first place in the ICDAR 2025 DIMT Challenge (Small Model Track). Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on OCRBench among VLMs with fewer than 3B parameters.\n  HunyuanOCR achieves breakthroughs in three key aspects: 1) Unifying Versatility and Efficiency: We implement comprehensive support for core capabilities including spotting, parsing, IE, VQA, and translation within a lightweight framework. This addresses the limitations of narrow \"OCR expert models\" and inefficient \"General VLMs\". 2) Streamlined End-to-End Architecture: Adopting a pure end-to-end paradigm eliminates dependencies on pre-processing modules (e.g., layout analysis).

Rapid information gathering and comprehensive structural assessment of buildings have different requirements and therefore necessitate distinct methodologies. In this paper, we propose a novel modular Next-Best-View (NBV) planning framework for aerial robots that explicitly uses a reconstruction quality objective to guide the exploration planning. In particular, our approach introduces new and efficient methods for view generation and selection of viewpoint candidates that are adaptive to the user-defined quality requirements, fully exploiting the uncertainty encoded in a Truncated Signed Distance field (TSDF) representation of the environment. This results in informed and efficient exploration decisions tailored towards the predetermined objective. Finally, we validate our method via extensive simulations in realistic environments. We demonstrate that it successfully adjusts its behavior to the user goal while consistently outperforming conventional NBV strategies in terms of coverage, quality of the final 3D map and path efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u7a7a\u4e2d\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316Next-Best-View\u89c4\u5212\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u76ee\u6807\u6307\u5bfc\u63a2\u7d22\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u89c6\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\u30013D\u5730\u56fe\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8def\u5f84\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfNBV\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u4e3b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5730\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u9700\u6c42\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u89c4\u5212\u7b56\u7565\u5f80\u5f80\u5ffd\u7565\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u5feb\u901f\u4fe1\u606f\u6536\u96c6\u4e0e\u5168\u9762\u7ed3\u6784\u8bc4\u4f30\uff09\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u9700\u6c42\u5f00\u53d1\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6a21\u5757\u5316NBV\u89c4\u5212\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8eTSDF\u73af\u5883\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u89c6\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u548c\u5019\u9009\u89c6\u70b9\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u6ee1\u8db3\u7528\u6237\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u6839\u636e\u7528\u6237\u76ee\u6807\u8c03\u6574\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5728\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\u3001\u6700\u7ec83D\u5730\u56fe\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8def\u5f84\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfNBV\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316NBV\u89c4\u5212\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u76ee\u6807\u6307\u5bfc\u63a2\u7d22\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u73af\u5883\u63a2\u7d22\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, real-time adaptability in dynamic environments remains a critical challenge for autonomous navigation, particularly when robots must generate collision-free, smooth, and efficient trajectories under complex constraints. By analyzing the difficulties in dynamic path planning, the Wind Driven Optimization (WDO) algorithm emerges as a promising framework owing to its physically interpretable search dynamics. Motivated by these observations, this work revisits the WDO principle and proposes a variant formulation, Multi-hierarchical adaptive wind driven optimization(MAWDO), that improves adaptability and robustness in time-varying environments. To mitigate instability and premature convergence, a hierarchical-guidance mechanism divides the population into multiple groups guided by individual, regional, and global leaders to balance exploration and exploitation. Extensive evaluations on sixteen benchmark functions show that MAWDO achieves superior optimization accuracy, convergence stability, and adaptability over state-of-the art metaheuristics. In dynamic path planning, MAWDO shortens the path length to 469.28 pixels, improving over Multi-strategy ensemble wind driven optimization(MEWDO), Adaptive wind driven optimization(AWDO) and WDO by 3.51\\%, 11.63\\% and 14.93\\%, and achieves the smallest optimality gap (1.01) with smoothness 0.71 versus 13.50 and 15.67 for AWDO and WDO, leading to smoother, shorter, and collision-free trajectories that confirm its effectiveness for real-time path planning in complex environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u5c42\u7ea7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u98ce\u9a71\u52a8\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5(MAWDO)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u5f15\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\u6539\u8fdb\u4f20\u7edf\u98ce\u9a71\u52a8\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u77ed\u3001\u66f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u78b0\u649e\u81ea\u7531\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "motivation": "\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u662f\u81ea\u4e3b\u5bfc\u822a\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u78b0\u649e\u81ea\u7531\u3001\u5e73\u6ed1\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002\u98ce\u9a71\u52a8\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u56e0\u5176\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u800c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MAWDO\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u5f15\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\u5c06\u79cd\u7fa4\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u591a\u4e2a\u7ec4\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u7531\u4e2a\u4f53\u3001\u533a\u57df\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u65e9\u719f\u6536\u655b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u572816\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u51fd\u6570\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793aMAWDO\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u6536\u655b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5143\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\uff0cMAWDO\u5c06\u8def\u5f84\u957f\u5ea6\u7f29\u77ed\u81f3469.28\u50cf\u7d20\uff0c\u6bd4MEWDO\u3001AWDO\u548cWDO\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u53473.51%\u300111.63%\u548c14.93%\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5c0f\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u5dee\u8ddd(1.01)\u548c\u5e73\u6ed1\u5ea60.71\u3002", "conclusion": "MAWDO\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u3001\u66f4\u77ed\u4e14\u65e0\u78b0\u649e\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u65f6\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Imaging Systems and Techniques (IST 2025), Strasburg, France", "summary": "Gastrointestinal (GI) imaging via Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) generates a large number of images requiring manual screening. Deep learning-based Clinical Decision Support (CDS) systems can assist screening, yet their performance relies on the existence of large, diverse, training medical datasets. However, the scarcity of such data, due to privacy constraints and annotation costs, hinders CDS development. Generative machine learning offers a viable solution to combat this limitation. While current Synthetic Data Generation (SDG) methods, such as Generative Adversarial Networks and Variational Autoencoders have been explored, they often face challenges with training stability and capturing sufficient visual diversity, especially when synthesizing abnormal findings. This work introduces a novel VAE-based methodology for medical image synthesis and presents its application for the generation of WCE images. The novel contributions of this work include a) multiscale extension of the Vector Quantized VAE model, named as Multiscale Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (MSVQ-VAE); b) unlike other VAE-based SDG models for WCE image generation, MSVQ-VAE is used to seamlessly introduce abnormalities into normal WCE images; c) it enables conditional generation of synthetic images, enabling the introduction of different types of abnormalities into the normal WCE images; d) it performs experiments with a variety of abnormality types, including polyps, vascular and inflammatory conditions.

We introduce SkillSight for power-efficient skill assessment from first-person data. Central to our approach is the hypothesis that skill level is evident not only in how a person performs an activity (video), but also in how they direct their attention when doing so (gaze). Our two-stage framework first learns to jointly model gaze and egocentric video when predicting skill level, then distills a gaze-only student model. At inference, the student model requires only gaze input, drastically reducing power consumption by eliminating continuous video processing. Experiments on three datasets spanning cooking, music, and sports establish, for the first time, the valuable role of gaze in skill understanding across diverse real-world settings. Our SkillSight teacher model achieves state-of-the-art performance, while our gaze-only student variant maintains high accuracy using 73x less power than competing methods.

Methods: We proposed a semantic distribution-guided reconstruction framework that uses a pre-trained vision-language foundation model to encode both the reconstructed image and auxiliary information into high-level semantic features. A contrastive objective aligns the reconstructed representation with the target semantic distribution, ensuring consistency with high-level perceptual cues. The proposed objective works with various deep learning-based reconstruction methods and can flexibly incorporate semantic priors from multimodal sources. To test the effectiveness of these semantic priors, we evaluated reconstruction results guided by priors derived from either image-only or image-language auxiliary information. Results: Experiments on knee and brain datasets demonstrate that semantic priors from images preserve fine anatomical structures and achieve superior perceptual quality, as reflected in lower LPIPS values, higher Tenengrad scores, and improved scores in the reader study, compared with conventional regularization. The image-language information further expands the semantic distribution and enables high-level control over reconstruction attributes. Across all evaluations, the contrastive objective consistently guided the reconstructed features toward the desired semantic distributions while maintaining data fidelity, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed optimization framework.

However, prior studies have used either low-resolution thumbnails or random patches, which likely underestimated model performance. Here, we ask whether LMMs can be adapted to reason coherently and accurately in the evaluation of such images. In this study, we introduce Gigapixel Image Agent for Navigating Tissue (GIANT), the first framework that allows LMMs to iteratively navigate whole-slide images (WSIs) like a pathologist. Accompanying GIANT, we release MultiPathQA, a new benchmark, which comprises 934 WSI-level questions, encompassing five clinically-relevant tasks ranging from cancer diagnosis to open-ended reasoning. MultiPathQA also includes 128 questions, authored by two professional pathologists, requiring direct slide interpretation. Using MultiPathQA, we show that our simple agentic system substantially outperforms conventional patch- and thumbnail-based baselines, approaching or surpassing the performance of specialized models trained on millions of images. For example, on pathologist-authored questions, GPT-5 with GIANT achieves 62.5% accuracy, outperforming specialist pathology models such as TITAN (43.8%) and SlideChat (37.5%).

Employing an attention-based encoder-decoder backbone, it jointly segments four ROIs - masses, calcifications, axillary findings, and breast tissues - with state-of-the-art accuracy and robustly predicts ten structured clinical features: mass morphology, calcification type, ACR breast density, and BI-RADS categories. To fuse imaging and clinical insights, we developed two late-fusion strategies. By utilizing complementary multimodal data, late fusion strategies improve diagnostic precision and reduce inter-observer variability. Operationalized as a secure, user-friendly web application, OncoVision produces structured reports with dual-confidence scoring and attention-weighted visualizations for real-time diagnostic support to improve clinician trust and facilitate medical teaching. It can be easily incorporated into the clinic, making screening available in underprivileged areas around the world, such as rural South Asia.

By integrating altitude-dependent scaling with an adaptive tiling factor, we reduce unnecessary computation while maintaining detection performance.

Existing approaches either rely on limited segmentation training data, which hinders generalization, or apply zero-shot heuristics to vision-language models (e.g CLIP), while the most competitive approaches combine multiple models to improve performance at the cost of high computational and memory demands. In this work, we leverage an overlooked agglomerative vision foundation model, RADIO, to improve zero-shot OVSS along three key axes simultaneously: mIoU, latency, and parameter efficiency.

This leaves an underexplored research question: can we reduce the number of stacked transformer layers while maintaining comparable representational capacity? To answer this, we propose a branch-based structural reparameterization technique that operates during the training phase. Our approach leverages parallel branches within transformer blocks that can be systematically consolidated into streamlined single-path models suitable for inference deployment. The consolidation mechanism works by gradually merging branches at the entry points of nonlinear components, enabling both feed-forward networks (FFN) and multi-head self-attention (MHSA) modules to undergo exact mathematical reparameterization without inducing approximation errors at test time. When applied to ViT-Tiny, the framework successfully reduces the original 12-layer architecture to 6, 4, or as few as 3 layers while maintaining classification accuracy on ImageNet-1K. The resulting compressed models achieve inference speedups of up to 37% on mobile CPU platforms.

Existing fixes -- freezing modules or applying uniform regularization -- either overconstrain adaptation or ignore the differing roles of VLA components. We present MAPS (Module-Wise Proximity Scheduling), the first robust fine-tuning framework for VLAs. Through systematic analysis, we uncover an empirical order in which proximity constraints should be relaxed to balance stability and flexibility. MAPS linearly schedules this relaxation, enabling visual encoders to stay close to their pretrained priors while action-oriented language layers adapt more freely.

The computation cost of OT, however, hinders its scalability. Slice-based transport plans have recently shown promise for reducing the computational cost by leveraging the closed-form solutions of 1D OT problems. These methods optimize a one-dimensional projection (slice) to obtain a conditional transport plan that minimizes the transport cost in the ambient space. While efficient, these methods leave open the question of whether learned optimal slicers can transfer to new distribution pairs under distributional shift. Understanding this transferability is crucial in settings with evolving data or repeated OT computations across closely related distributions. In this paper, we study the min-Sliced Transport Plan (min-STP) framework and investigate the transferability of optimized slicers: can a slicer trained on one distribution pair yield effective transport plans for new, unseen pairs? Theoretically, we show that optimized slicers remain close under slight perturbations of the data distributions, enabling efficient transfer across related tasks. To further improve scalability, we introduce a minibatch formulation of min-STP and provide statistical guarantees on its accuracy. Empirically, we demonstrate that the transferable min-STP achieves strong one-shot matching performance and facilitates amortized training for point cloud alignment and flow-based generative modeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6700\u5c0f\u5207\u7247\u4f20\u8f93\u8ba1\u5212\uff08min-STP\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u4f18\u5316\u5207\u7247\u5668\u7684\u53ef\u8f6c\u79fb\u6027\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\uff0c\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5207\u7247\u5668\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u65b0\u7684\u672a\u89c1\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u3002", "motivation": "\u5207\u7247\u4f20\u8f93\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u4e00\u7ef4\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\u6765\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\u4f18\u5316\u5207\u7247\u5668\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u8f6c\u79fb\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u79cd\u53ef\u8f6c\u79fb\u6027\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u65ad\u6f14\u5316\u6216\u9700\u8981\u5728\u76f8\u5173\u5206\u5e03\u95f4\u91cd\u590d\u8ba1\u7b97OT\u7684\u573a\u666f\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6700\u5c0f\u5207\u7247\u4f20\u8f93\u8ba1\u5212\uff08min-STP\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4f18\u5316\u5207\u7247\u5668\u7684\u53ef\u8f6c\u79fb\u6027\u3002\u5f15\u5165minibatch\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684min-STP\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u5176\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u4f18\u5316\u5207\u7247\u5668\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u8f7b\u5fae\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u9ad8\u6548\u8f6c\u79fb\u3002\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\u53ef\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684min-STP\u5728\u70b9\u4e91\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5f3a\u7684\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u5339\u914d\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u644a\u9500\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f18\u5316\u5207\u7247\u5668\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u8f6c\u79fb\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6709\u6548\uff0cmin-STP\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u8ba1\u7b97\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Recent end-to-end systems and world-model-based planners predict rich multi-modal trajectories, but typically rely on handcrafted anchors or reinforcement learning to select a single best mode for training and control. This selection discards information about alternative futures and complicates optimization. We propose MAP-World, a prior-free multi-modal planning framework that couples masked action planning with a path-weighted world model. The Masked Action Planning (MAP) module treats future ego motion as masked sequence completion: past waypoints are encoded as visible tokens, future waypoints are represented as mask tokens, and a driving-intent path provides a coarse scaffold. A compact latent planning state is expanded into multiple trajectory queries with injected noise, yielding diverse, temporally consistent modes without anchor libraries or teacher policies. A lightweight world model then rolls out future BEV semantics conditioned on each candidate trajectory. During training, semantic losses are computed as an expectation over modes, using trajectory probabilities as discrete path weights, so the planner learns from the full distribution of plausible futures instead of a single selected path.

Traditional LiDAR-camera fusion approaches require complex calibration and still struggle with certain materials like glass, which are visible in images but poorly represented in point clouds. We propose a camera-only pipeline that reconstructs scenes using 3D Gaussian Splatting from multi-view images, extracts semantic material masks via vision models, converts Gaussian representations to mesh surfaces with projected material labels, and assigns physics-based material properties for accurate sensor simulation in modern graphics engines and simulators. This approach combines photorealistic reconstruction with physics-based material assignment, providing sensor simulation fidelity comparable to LiDAR-camera fusion while eliminating hardware complexity and calibration requirements.

In this work, we integrate VLM-based segmentation into semi-supervised medical image segmentation by introducing a Vision-Language Enhanced Semi-supervised Segmentation Assistant (VESSA) that incorporates foundation-level visual-semantic understanding into SSL frameworks. Our approach consists of two stages. In Stage 1, the VLM-enhanced segmentation foundation model VESSA is trained as a reference-guided segmentation assistant using a template bank containing gold-standard exemplars, simulating learning from limited labeled data. Given an input-template pair, VESSA performs visual feature matching to extract representative semantic and spatial cues from exemplar segmentations, generating structured prompts for a SAM2-inspired mask decoder to produce segmentation masks. In Stage 2, VESSA is integrated into a state-of-the-art SSL framework, enabling dynamic interaction with the student model: as student predictions become more refined, they are fed back to VESSA as prompts, allowing it to generate higher-quality pseudo-labels and stronger guidance.

We revisit the SegFormer decoder and show that three small, synergistic changes make weak supervision markedly more effective-without altering the MiT backbone or relying on heavy post-processing. Our method, CrispFormer, augments the decoder with: (1) a boundary branch that supervises thin object contours using a lightweight edge head and a boundary-aware loss; (2) an uncertainty-guided refiner that predicts per-pixel aleatoric uncertainty and uses it to weight losses and gate a residual correction of the segmentation logits; and (3) a dynamic multi-scale fusion layer that replaces static concatenation with spatial softmax gating over multi-resolution features, optionally modulated by uncertainty. The result is a single-pass model that preserves crisp boundaries, selects appropriate scales per location, and resists label noise from weak cues. Integrated into a standard WSSS pipeline (seed, student, and EMA relabeling), CrispFormer consistently improves boundary F-score, small-object recall, and mIoU over SegFormer baselines trained on the same seeds, while adding minimal compute.

When tokens from different spatial grids are mixed, the attention mechanism collapses. The issue is structural. Linear coordinate remapping forces a single attention head to compare RoPE phases sampled at incompatible rates, creating phase aliasing that destabilizes the score landscape. Pretrained DiTs are especially brittle-many heads exhibit extremely sharp, periodic phase selectivity-so even tiny cross-rate inconsistencies reliably cause blur, artifacts, or full collapse.\n  To this end, our main contribution is Cross-Resolution Phase-Aligned Attention (CRPA), a training-free drop-in fix that eliminates this failure at its source. CRPA modifies only the RoPE index map for each attention call: all Q/K positions are expressed on the query's stride so that equal physical distances always induce identical phase increments. This restores the precise phase patterns that DiTs rely on. CRPA is fully compatible with pretrained DiTs, stabilizes all heads and layers uniformly.

For example, OCR errors like misreading \"50 mph\" as \"60 mph\" could cause severe traffic accidents. This leads us to ask: Can VLMs know when they can't see? Existing abstention methods suggest pessimistic answers: they either rely on miscalibrated output probabilities or require semantic agreement unsuitable for OCR tasks. However, this failure may indicate we are looking in the wrong place: uncertainty signals could be hidden in VLMs' internal representations.\n  Building on this insight, we propose Latent Representation Probing (LRP): training lightweight probes on hidden states or attention patterns. We explore three probe designs: concatenating representations across all layers, aggregating attention over visual tokens, and ensembling single layer probes by majority vote. Experiments on four benchmarks across image and video modalities show LRP improves abstention accuracy by 7.6\\% over best baselines. Our analysis reveals: probes generalize across various uncertainty sources and datasets, and optimal signals emerge from intermediate rather than final layers. This establishes a principled framework for building deployment-ready AI systems by detecting confidence signals from internal states rather than unreliable outputs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faLRP\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u63a2\u9488\u6765\u68c0\u6d4bVLM\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728STVQA\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5f03\u6743\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u53477.6%\u7684\u5f03\u6743\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "VLM\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u5177\u5907\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u65f6\u5f03\u6743\u56de\u7b54\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728STVQA\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2dOCR\u9519\u8bef\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e25\u91cd\u540e\u679c\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5f03\u6743\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4fe1\u53f7\u53ef\u80fd\u9690\u85cf\u5728VLM\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u63a2\u6d4b(LRP)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5728\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u6216\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u63a2\u9488\u3002\u63a2\u7d22\u4e09\u79cd\u63a2\u9488\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff1a\u8de8\u5c42\u8fde\u63a5\u8868\u793a\u3001\u805a\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u3001\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6570\u6295\u7968\u96c6\u6210\u5355\u5c42\u63a2\u9488\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0cLRP\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u4f73\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u53477.6%\u7684\u5f03\u6743\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002\u63a2\u9488\u80fd\u591f\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u5404\u79cd\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6765\u6e90\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6700\u4f73\u4fe1\u53f7\u6765\u81ea\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u800c\u975e\u6700\u7ec8\u5c42\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u800c\u975e\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u8f93\u51fa\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u7f6e\u4fe1\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u539f\u5219\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

In this paper, we revisit attention sparsity and reveal that existing methods induce systematic biases in attention allocation: (1) excessive focus on critical tokens amplifies their attention weights; (2) complete neglect of non-critical tokens causes the loss of relevant attention weights. To address these issues, we propose Rectified SpaAttn, which rectifies attention allocation with implicit full attention reference, thereby enhancing the alignment between sparse and full attention maps. Specifically: (1) for critical tokens, we show that their bias is proportional to the sparse attention weights, with the ratio governed by the amplified weights. Accordingly, we propose Isolated-Pooling Attention Reallocation, which calculates accurate rectification factors by reallocating multimodal pooled weights. (2) for non-critical tokens, recovering attention weights from the pooled query-key yields attention gains but also introduces pooling errors. Therefore, we propose Gain-Aware Pooling Rectification, which ensures that the rectified gain consistently surpasses the induced error. Moreover, we customize and integrate the Rectified SpaAttn kernel using Triton, achieving up to 3.33 and 2.08 times speedups on HunyuanVideo and Wan 2.1, respectively, while maintaining high generation quality.

However, fine-tuned models suffer from catastrophic forgetting. We create models that perform four tasks (object recognition, face recognition from high- and low-quality images, and person recognition from whole-body images) in a single embedding space -- without incurring substantial catastrophic forgetting. To accomplish this, we introduce two variants of the Interleaved Multi-Domain Identity Curriculum (IMIC): a gradient-coupled, interleaving training schedule that fine-tunes a foundation backbone simultaneously on all four tasks. The IMIC method proved effective with three foundation model bases: DINOv3, CLIP, and EVA-02. Two of these (EVA-02 and CLIP) performed comparably with domain experts on all four tasks concurrently and were more accurate than humans at multi-tasking across face, body, and object datasets. Further, we demonstrate that our approach does not substantially harm out-of-distribution generalization, thus maintaining a key property of foundation models. Analysis of the most accurate model variants (EVA-02 + IMIC A and B) showed linearly separable representations of the four tasks in the unified embedding space, but with substantial sharing of features across tasks.

Existing methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting typically bind Gaussians to mesh triangles and model deformations solely via Linear Blend Skinning, which results in rigid motion and limited expressiveness. Moreover, they lack specialized strategies to handle frequently occluded regions (e.g., mouth interiors, eyelids). To address these limitations, we propose STAvatar, which consists of two key components: (1) a UV-Adaptive Soft Binding framework that leverages both image-based and geometric priors to learn per-Gaussian feature offsets within the UV space. This UV representation supports dynamic resampling, ensuring full compatibility with Adaptive Density Control (ADC) and enhanced adaptability to shape and textural variations. (2) a Temporal ADC strategy, which first clusters structurally similar frames to facilitate more targeted computation of the densification criterion. It further introduces a novel fused perceptual error as clone criterion to jointly capture geometric and textural discrepancies, encouraging densification in regions requiring finer details. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that STAvatar achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance, especially in capturing fine-grained details and reconstructing frequently occluded regions.

However, the potential of using non-visual, continuous sequential, as a conditioning signal for high-fidelity image generation remains largely unexplored. Furthermore, existing methods that convert series into \"pseudo-images\" for temporal forecasting fail to establish semantic-level alignment. In this paper, we propose TimeArtist, a temporal-visual conversion framework that pioneers semantic-level alignment between time series fluctuations and visual concepts. It pioneers a \"warmup-align\" paradigm: first, a dual-autoencoder and shared quantizer are self-supervised trained on large-scale datasets to learn modality-shared representations. Then, the encoders and quantizer are frozen, and a projection is introduced to align temporal and visual samples at the representation level.

However, existing methodologies based on vision transformers or state-space models typically disrupt local structural consistency during temporal serialization, obscuring discriminative cues under misalignment and hindering reliable change localization. To address this, we introduce ChessMamba, a structure-aware framework leveraging interleaved state-space modeling for robust CD with multi-temporal inputs. ChessMamba integrates a SpatialMamba encoder with a lightweight cross-source interaction module, featuring two key innovations: (i) Chessboard interleaving with snake scanning order, which serializes multi-temporal features into a unified sequence within a single forward pass, thereby shortening interaction paths and enabling direct comparison for accurate change localization; and (ii) Structure-aware fusion via multi-dilated convolutions, selectively capturing center-and-corner neighborhood contexts within each mono-temporal. Comprehensive evaluations on three CD tasks, including binary CD, semantic CD and multimodal building damage assessment, demonstrate that ChessMamba effectively fuses heterogeneous features and achieves substantial accuracy improvements over state-of-the-art methods.The relevant code will be available at: github.com/DingLei14/ChessMamba.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86ChessMamba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u68cb\u76d8\u4ea4\u9519\u626b\u63cf\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u878d\u5408\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u65f6\u76f8\u9065\u611f\u5f71\u50cf\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u65f6\u76f8\u9065\u611f\u5f71\u50cf\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u9762\u4e34\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\u6216\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7834\u574f\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u96be\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u5224\u522b\u6027\u7ebf\u7d22\u5e76\u53ef\u9760\u5b9a\u4f4d\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "method": "ChessMamba\u6846\u67b6\u96c6\u6210\u4e86SpatialMamba\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8de8\u6e90\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u68cb\u76d8\u4ea4\u9519\u626b\u63cf\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u591a\u65f6\u76f8\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6269\u5f20\u5377\u79ef\u8fdb\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6355\u6349\u5355\u65f6\u76f8\u5185\u7684\u4e2d\u5fc3\u548c\u89d2\u70b9\u90bb\u57df\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u4e8c\u5143\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5efa\u7b51\u635f\u4f24\u8bc4\u4f30\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0cChessMamba\u6709\u6548\u878d\u5408\u4e86\u5f02\u8d28\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "ChessMamba\u901a\u8fc7\u68cb\u76d8\u4ea4\u9519\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u65f6\u76f8\u8f93\u5165\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, its effectiveness diminishes in cross-modal scenarios, such as vision-to-language distillation, where inconsistencies in representation across modalities lead to difficult knowledge transfer. To address this challenge, we propose frequency-decoupled cross-modal knowledge distillation, a method designed to decouple and balance knowledge transfer across modalities by leveraging frequency-domain features. We observed that low-frequency features exhibit high consistency across different modalities, whereas high-frequency features demonstrate extremely low cross-modal similarity. Accordingly, we apply distinct losses to these features: enforcing strong alignment in the low-frequency domain and introducing relaxed alignment for high-frequency features. We also propose a scale consistency loss to address distributional shifts between modalities, and employ a shared classifier to unify feature spaces. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets show our method substantially outperforms traditional KD and state-of-the-art cross-modal KD approaches.

Although CAD technology has advanced in recent years, the application scope of existing datasets remains relatively limited, typically supporting only single tasks, which has somewhat constrained the development of CAD technology. To address the above limitation, in this paper, we construct a multi-task liver dataset (LiMT) used for liver and tumor segmentation, multi-label lesion classification, and lesion detection based on arterial phase-enhanced computed tomography (CT), potentially providing an exploratory solution that is able to explore the correlation between tasks and does not need to worry about the heterogeneity between task-specific datasets during training. The dataset includes CT volumes from 150 different cases, comprising four types of liver diseases as well as normal cases. Each volume has been carefully annotated and calibrated by experienced clinicians.

A key bottleneck lies in the lack of public, large-scale, high-quality SVQA datasets. Although recent work uses LVLMs to synthesize data at scale, we identify systematic errors in their resulting QA pairs, stemming from LVLMs' inherent limitations and information asymmetry between figures and text. To address these challenges, we propose a verification-centric Generate-then-Verify framework that first generates QA pairs with figure-associated textual context, then applies cross-modal consistency checks against figures along with auxiliary filters to eliminate erroneous pairs. We instantiate this framework to curate VeriSciQA, a dataset of 20,351 QA pairs spanning 20 scientific domains and 12 figure types. VeriSciQA poses a challenging benchmark for open-source models, with a substantial accuracy gap between the leading open-source models (64%) and a proprietary model (82%). Moreover, models fine-tuned on VeriSciQA achieve consistent improvements on SVQA benchmarks, with performance gains that scale with data size and surpass models trained on existing datasets. Human evaluation further validates the superior correctness of VeriSciQA. Together, these evidences demonstrate that continued data expansion by our scalable framework can further advance SVQA capability in the open-source community.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u751f\u6210-\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u521b\u5efa\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u6570\u636e\u96c6VeriSciQA\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u6e90\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\u5728\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u516c\u5f00\u3001\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528LVLMs\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4ee5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u751f\u6210-\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u751f\u6210\u5e26\u6709\u56fe\u76f8\u5173\u6587\u672c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5e94\u7528\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u68c0\u67e5\u548c\u8f85\u52a9\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\u6765\u6d88\u9664\u9519\u8bef\u5bf9\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6784\u5efa\u4e86VeriSciQA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b20,351\u4e2a\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\u7684VeriSciQA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d620\u4e2a\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u548c12\u79cd\u56fe\u8868\u7c7b\u578b\u3002\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5bf9\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u6210\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9886\u5148\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e3a64%\uff0c\u800c\u4e13\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a82%\u3002\u5728VeriSciQA\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728SVQA\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6301\u7eed\u6269\u5c55\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a8\u8fdb\u5f00\u6e90\u793e\u533a\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86VeriSciQA\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

For improved robustness, we use 3D skeletal features extracted from sign language videos to capture the convergence of sign properties and their dynamics, which tend to cluster at sign boundaries. Another focus of this work is the incorporation of information from 3D handshape for boundary detection. To detect handshapes normally expected at the beginning and end of signs, we pretrain a handshape classifier for 87 linguistically defined canonical handshape categories using a dataset that we created by integrating and normalizing several existing datasets. A multimodal fusion module is then used to unify the pretrained sign video segmentation framework and the handshape classification models. Finally, the estimated boundaries are used for sign recognition, where the recognition model is trained on a large database containing both citation-form isolated signs and signs pre-segmented (based on manual annotations) from continuous signing, as such signs often differ in certain respects. We evaluate our method on the ASLLRP corpus and demonstrate significant improvements over previous work.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8fde\u7eed\u624b\u8bed\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u54083D\u9aa8\u9abc\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u624b\u5f62\u5206\u7c7b\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u624b\u8bed\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728ASLLRP\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fde\u7eed\u624b\u8bed\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u68c0\u6d4b\u624b\u8bed\u5f00\u59cb\u548c\u7ed3\u675f\u5e27\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bc6\u522b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6574\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u75283D\u9aa8\u9abc\u7279\u5f81\u6355\u6349\u624b\u8bed\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec387\u79cd\u624b\u5f62\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u5272\u548c\u624b\u5f62\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728ASLLRP\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u54083D\u9aa8\u9abc\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u624b\u5f62\u4fe1\u606f\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u8fde\u7eed\u624b\u8bed\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Previous works typically employ geometric, generative, or simulation priors to guide the transfer process, but these external priors introduce auxiliary constraints that lead to trade-offs between generalizability and temporal consistency. To address these limitations, we propose guiding the motion transfer process through an internal prior that exclusively captures the spatial-temporal transformations and is shared between the source video and any transferred target video. Specifically, we first lift both the source video and the target image into a unified 3D representation space. Motion trajectories are then extracted from the source video to construct a spatial-temporal (SpaT) prior that is independent of object geometry and semantics, encoding relative spatial variations over time. This prior is further integrated with the target object to synthesize a controllable velocity field, which is subsequently refined using Position-Based Dynamics to mitigate artifacts and enhance visual coherence.

This mechanism spatially modulates dual 3D visual streams-extracted by parallel 3D-CNNs processing raw projection stacks and their diffusion-diffraction corrected counterparts allowing the model to recalibrate its visual perception based on the physical context.

However, existing TTS methods operate at the full-image level, overlooking the fact that image quality is often spatially heterogeneous. This leads to unnecessary computation on already satisfactory regions and insufficient correction of localized defects. In this paper, we explore a new direction - Localized TTS - that adaptively resamples defective regions while preserving high-quality regions, thereby substantially reducing the search space. This paradigm poses two central challenges: accurately localizing defects and maintaining global consistency. We propose LoTTS, the first fully training-free framework for localized TTS. For defect localization, LoTTS contrasts cross- and self-attention signals under quality-aware prompts (e.g., high-quality vs. low-quality) to identify defective regions, and then refines them into coherent masks. For consistency, LoTTS perturbs only defective regions and denoises them locally, ensuring that corrections remain confined while the rest of the image remains undisturbed. Extensive experiments on SD2.1, SDXL, and FLUX demonstrate that LoTTS achieves state-of-the-art performance: it consistently improves both local quality and global fidelity, while reducing GPU cost by 2-4x compared to Best-of-N sampling.

Project page at https://yufanchen96.github.io/projects/HybriDLA", "summary": "Conventional document layout analysis (DLA) traditionally depends on empirical priors or a fixed set of learnable queries executed in a single forward pass. While sufficient for early-generation documents with a small, predetermined number of regions, this paradigm struggles with contemporary documents, which exhibit diverse element counts and increasingly complex layouts. To address challenges posed by modern documents, we present HybriDLA, a novel generative framework that unifies diffusion and autoregressive decoding within a single layer. The diffusion component iteratively refines bounding-box hypotheses, whereas the autoregressive component injects semantic and contextual awareness, enabling precise region prediction even in highly varied layouts. To further enhance detection quality, we design a multi-scale feature-fusion encoder that captures both fine-grained and high-level visual cues.

However, conventional methods face significant limitations: manual features (e.g., SIFT) lack robustness; deep learning-based detectors (e.g., YOLO) can identify component presence but cannot perform state-specific retrieval or zero-shot search; Visual Large Models (VLMs) offer semantic and zero-shot capabilities but suffer from poor spatial grounding and high computational cost, making them inefficient for direct retrieval. To bridge these gaps, this paper proposes DetVLM, a novel intelligent image search framework that synergistically fuses object detection with VLMs. The framework pioneers a search-enhancement paradigm via a two-stage pipeline: a YOLO detector first conducts efficient, high-recall component-level screening to determine component presence; then, a VLM acts as a recall-enhancement unit, performing secondary verification for components missed by the detector. This architecture directly enables two advanced capabilities: 1) State Search: Guided by task-specific prompts, the VLM refines results by verifying component existence and executing sophisticated state judgments (e.g., \"sun visor lowered\"), allowing retrieval based on component state. 2) Zero-shot Search: The framework leverages the VLM's inherent zero-shot capability to recognize and retrieve images containing unseen components or attributes (e.g., \"driver wearing a mask\") without any task-specific training. Experiments on a vehicle component dataset show DetVLM achieves a state-of-the-art overall retrieval accuracy of 94.82\\%, significantly outperforming detection-only baselines. It also attains 94.95\\% accuracy in zero-shot search for driver mask-wearing and over 90\\% average accuracy in state search tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "DetVLM\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u7d22\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u7a0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u72b6\u6001\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u5728\u8f66\u8f86\u7ec4\u4ef6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523094.82%\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u7d22\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff1a\u624b\u52a8\u7279\u5f81\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u65e0\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u72b6\u6001\u7279\u5b9a\u68c0\u7d22\u6216\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u89c6\u89c9\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5dee\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u4f7f\u7528YOLO\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9ad8\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u7684\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7ea7\u7b5b\u9009\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4f7f\u7528VLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ec\u56de\u589e\u5f3a\u5355\u5143\uff0c\u5bf9\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u9057\u6f0f\u7684\u7ec4\u4ef6\u8fdb\u884c\u4e8c\u6b21\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8f66\u8f86\u7ec4\u4ef6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b094.82%\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u68c0\u7d22\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u5728\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u6234\u53e3\u7f69\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u641c\u7d22\u4e2d\u8fbe\u523094.95%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u72b6\u6001\u641c\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8d85\u8fc790%\u3002", "conclusion": "DetVLM\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u878d\u5408\u4e86\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u72b6\u6001\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u68c0\u67e5\u548c\u5de5\u4e1a\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, their capability for counterfactual reasoning, inferring alternative outcomes under hypothetical conditions, remains underexplored. This capability is essential for robust video understanding, as it requires identifying underlying causal structures and reasoning about unobserved possibilities, rather than merely recognizing observed patterns. To systematically evaluate this capability, we introduce CounterVQA, a video-based benchmark featuring three progressive difficulty levels that assess different aspects of counterfactual reasoning. Through comprehensive evaluation of both state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source models, we uncover a substantial performance gap: while these models achieve reasonable accuracy on simple counterfactual questions, performance degrades significantly on complex multi-hop causal chains. To address these limitations, we develop a post-training method, CFGPT, that enhances a model's visual counterfactual reasoning ability by distilling its counterfactual reasoning capability from the language modality, yielding consistent improvements across all CounterVQA difficulty levels.

However, enabling an excessive proportion of background search tokens to attend to the target template tokens weakens the tracker's discriminative capability. Several token pruning methods have been proposed to mitigate background interference; however, they often remove tokens near the target, leading to the loss of essential contextual information and degraded tracking performance. Moreover, the presence of distractors within the search tokens further reduces the tracker's ability to accurately identify the target. To address these limitations, we propose CPDATrack, a novel tracking framework designed to suppress interference from background and distractor tokens while enhancing computational efficiency. First, a learnable module is integrated between two designated encoder layers to estimate the probability of each search token being associated with the target. Based on these estimates, less-informative background tokens are pruned from the search region while preserving the contextual cues surrounding the target. To further suppress background interference, a discriminative selective attention mechanism is employed that fully blocks search-to-template attention in the early layers. In the subsequent encoder layers, high-probability target tokens are selectively extracted from a localized region to attend to the template tokens, thereby reducing the influence of background and distractor tokens.

However, when confronted with complex prompts involving multiple objects and hierarchical structures, existing models struggle to accurately follow instructions, leading to issues such as concept omission, confusion, and poor compositionality. To address these limitations, we propose a Hierarchical Compositional Generative framework (HiCoGen) built upon a novel Chain of Synthesis (CoS) paradigm. Instead of monolithic generation, HiCoGen first leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to decompose complex prompts into minimal semantic units. It then synthesizes these units iteratively, where the image generated in each step provides crucial visual context for the next, ensuring all textual concepts are faithfully constructed into the final scene. To further optimize this process, we introduce a reinforcement learning (RL) framework. Crucially, we identify that the limited exploration of standard diffusion samplers hinders effective RL. We theoretically prove that sample diversity is maximized by concentrating stochasticity in the early generation stages and, based on this insight, propose a novel Decaying Stochasticity Schedule to enhance exploration. Our RL algorithm is then guided by a hierarchical reward mechanism that jointly evaluates the image at the global, subject, and relationship levels. We also construct HiCoPrompt, a new text-to-image benchmark with hierarchical prompts for rigorous evaluation.

While 3D foundation models like VGGT provide accurate 3D geometry, their performance drops markedly when moving objects dominate. Existing 4D approaches often rely on external priors, heavy post-optimization, or require fine-tuning on 4D datasets. In this paper, we propose VGGT4D, a training-free framework that extends the 3D foundation model VGGT for robust 4D scene reconstruction. Our approach is motivated by the key finding that VGGT's global attention layers already implicitly encode rich, layer-wise dynamic cues. To obtain masks that decouple static and dynamic elements, we mine and amplify global dynamic cues via gram similarity and aggregate them across a temporal window. To further sharpen mask boundaries, we introduce a refinement strategy driven by projection gradient. We then integrate these precise masks into VGGT's early-stage inference, effectively mitigating motion interference in both pose estimation and geometric reconstruction. Across six datasets, our method achieves superior performance in dynamic object segmentation, camera pose estimation, and dense reconstruction.

Furthermore, we design a self-promotion textual feedback framework, in which the LVLM iteratively analyzes the emotional content of generated images and adaptively produces refinement suggestions for the next-round prompt, improving the emotional fidelity with fine-grained content.

While guidance-based methods in theory allow generic models to be used for inverse problems such as inpainting, in practice, their effectiveness is limited, leading to the necessity of specialized inpainting-specific models. In this work, we argue that the missing ingredient for training-free inpainting is the optimization (guidance) of the initial seed noise. We propose to optimize the initial seed noise to approximately match the unmasked parts of the data - with as few as a few tens of optimization steps. We then apply conventional training-free inpainting methods on top of our optimized initial seed noise. Critically, we propose two core ideas to effectively implement this idea: (i) to avoid the costly unrolling required to relate the initial noise and the generated outcome, we perform linear approximation; and (ii) to stabilize the optimization, we optimize the initial seed noise in the spectral domain. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on various inpainting tasks, outperforming the state of the art.

This paper introduces a multimodal approach to VR gaze prediction that combines temporal gaze patterns, head movement data, and visual scene information. By leveraging a gated fusion mechanism with cross-modal attention, the approach learns to adaptively weight gaze history, head movement, and scene content based on contextual relevance. Evaluations using a dataset spanning 22 VR scenes with 5.3M gaze samples demonstrate improvements in predictive accuracy when combining modalities compared to using individual data streams alone. The results indicate that integrating past gaze trajectories with head orientation and scene content enhances prediction accuracy across 1-3 future frames. Cross-scene generalization testing shows consistent performance with 93.1% validation accuracy and temporal consistency in predicted gaze trajectories. These findings contribute to understanding attention mechanisms in virtual environments while suggesting potential applications in rendering optimization, interaction design, and user experience evaluation.

This limitation arises because VAE-based latent compression inherently discards subtle texture information, causing identity- and attribute-specific cues to vanish. Moreover, post-editing approaches that amplify local details based on existing methods often produce results inconsistent with the original image in terms of lighting, texture, or shape. To address this, we introduce \\ourMthd{}, a detail-aware refinement framework that performs two consecutive stages of reference-driven correction to enhance pixel-level consistency. We first adapt a single-image diffusion editor by fine-tuning it to jointly ingest the draft image and the reference image, enabling globally coherent refinement while maintaining structural fidelity. We then apply reinforcement learning to further strengthen localized editing capability, explicitly optimizing for detail accuracy and semantic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \\ourMthd{} significantly improves reference alignment and fine-grained detail preservation, producing faithful and visually coherent edits that surpass both open-source and commercial models on challenging reference-guided restoration benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ec6\u8282\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u53c2\u8003\u9a71\u52a8\u4fee\u6b63\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u7ec6\u8282\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8eVAE\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f1a\u4e22\u5f03\u7ec6\u5fae\u7eb9\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8eab\u4efd\u548c\u5c5e\u6027\u7279\u5b9a\u7ebf\u7d22\u6d88\u5931\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u540e\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u653e\u5927\u5c40\u90e8\u7ec6\u8282\u65f6\u5f80\u5f80\u4e0e\u539f\u59cb\u56fe\u50cf\u5728\u5149\u7167\u3001\u7eb9\u7406\u6216\u5f62\u72b6\u4e0a\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u53c2\u8003\u9a71\u52a8\u4fee\u6b63\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u5355\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u7f16\u8f91\u5668\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u8349\u7a3f\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u5c40\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u7ec6\u5316\uff1b\u7136\u540e\u5e94\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5f3a\u5316\u5c40\u90e8\u7f16\u8f91\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u4f18\u5316\u7ec6\u8282\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u5f15\u5bfc\u6062\u590d\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u53c2\u8003\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7ec6\u8282\u4fdd\u6301\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u7ed3\u679c\u5728\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u5f00\u6e90\u548c\u5546\u4e1a\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\u611f\u77e5\u7ec6\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u4ea7\u751f\u5fe0\u5b9e\u4e14\u89c6\u89c9\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\u4fdd\u6301\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

When it comes to representing and assessing creativity, treating it as a single undifferentiated quantity would appear naive and underwhelming. In this work, we learn the \\emph{first type-specific creativity reward model}, coined CREward, which spans three creativity ``axes,\" geometry, material, and texture, to allow us to view creativity through the lens of the image formation pipeline. To build our reward model, we first conduct a human benchmark evaluation to capture human perception of creativity for each type across various creative images.

Building on this observation, we collect LVLM-generated labels to train our CREward model that is applicable to both evaluation and generation of creative images.

However, real-world models often operate in a sequence of decisions, where an isolated mistake can be easily corrected, but cascading errors can lead to severe risks.\n  This paper reveals a novel threat: a single perturbation can hijack the whole decision chain. We demonstrate the feasibility of manipulating a model's outputs toward multiple, predefined outcomes, such as simultaneously misclassifying \"non-motorized lane\" signs as \"motorized lane\" and \"pedestrian\" as \"plastic bag\".\n  To expose this threat, we introduce Semantic-Aware Universal Perturbations (SAUPs), which induce varied outcomes based on the semantics of the inputs. We overcome optimization challenges by developing an effective algorithm, which searches for perturbations in normalized space with a semantic separation strategy. To evaluate the practical threat of SAUPs, we present RIST, a new real-world image dataset with fine-grained semantic annotations. Extensive experiments on three multimodal large language models demonstrate their vulnerability, achieving a 70% attack success rate when controlling five distinct targets using just an adversarial frame.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u65b0\u5a01\u80c1\uff1a\u5355\u4e2a\u6270\u52a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u52ab\u6301\u6574\u4e2a\u51b3\u7b56\u94fe\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u591a\u4e2a\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u9519\u8bef\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u901a\u7528\u6270\u52a8(SAUPs)\u548c\u6709\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u8fdb\u884c\u5e8f\u5217\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u5b64\u7acb\u9519\u8bef\u5bb9\u6613\u88ab\u7ea0\u6b63\uff0c\u4f46\u7ea7\u8054\u9519\u8bef\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e25\u91cd\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u53ea\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u6b21\u51b3\u7b56\u64cd\u7eb5\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u4e2a\u6270\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u6574\u4e2a\u51b3\u7b56\u94fe\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u901a\u7528\u6270\u52a8(SAUPs)\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f93\u5165\u8bed\u4e49\u8bf1\u5bfc\u4e0d\u540c\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u6709\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u7a7a\u95f4\u641c\u7d22\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u89e3\u51b3\u4f18\u5316\u6311\u6218\u3002\u6784\u5efaRIST\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u4e2a\u5bf9\u6297\u5e27\u5c31\u80fd\u63a7\u5236\u4e94\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u8fbe\u523070%\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5355\u4e2a\u6270\u52a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u6210\u529f\u52ab\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u51b3\u7b56\u94fe\uff0c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6b64\u7c7b\u653b\u51fb\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754cAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u6784\u6210\u4e25\u91cd\u5a01\u80c1\u3002"}}

However, effectively extracting and integrating complementary cues from different types of data remains one of the major challenges. This paper proposes an attention-guided cross-modal interaction Transformer (ACIT) for pedestrian crossing intention prediction. ACIT leverages six visual and motion modalities, which are grouped into three interaction pairs: (1) Global semantic map and global optical flow, (2) Local RGB image and local optical flow, and (3) Ego-vehicle speed and pedestrian's bounding box. Within each visual interaction pair, a dual-path attention mechanism enhances salient regions within the primary modality through intra-modal self-attention and facilitates deep interactions with the auxiliary modality (i.e., optical flow) via optical flow-guided attention. Within the motion interaction pair, cross-modal attention is employed to model the cross-modal dynamics, enabling the effective extraction of complementary motion features. Beyond pairwise interactions, a multi-modal feature fusion module further facilitates cross-modal interactions at each time step. Furthermore, a Transformer-based temporal feature aggregation module is introduced to capture sequential dependencies. Experimental results demonstrate that ACIT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving accuracy rates of 70% and 89% on the JAADbeh and JAADall datasets, respectively. Extensive ablation studies are further conducted to investigate the contribution of different modules of ACIT.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faACIT\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92Transformer\u9884\u6d4b\u884c\u4eba\u8fc7\u8857\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u516d\u79cd\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4ea4\u4e92\u5bf9\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u6df1\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u5e76\u5728JAAD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u6574\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u7ebf\u7d22\u662f\u9884\u6d4b\u884c\u4eba\u8fc7\u8857\u610f\u56fe\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u9884\u9632\u884c\u4eba\u76f8\u5173\u78b0\u649e\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u516d\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u7ec4\u4e3a\u4e09\u4e2a\u4ea4\u4e92\u5bf9\uff1a\u5168\u5c40\u8bed\u4e49\u56fe\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u5149\u6d41\u3001\u5c40\u90e8RGB\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u5149\u6d41\u3001\u81ea\u8f66\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u884c\u4eba\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u8def\u5f84\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u5149\u6d41\u5f15\u5bfc\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u589e\u5f3a\u4e3b\u8981\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u663e\u8457\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5efa\u6a21\u8fd0\u52a8\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u805a\u5408Transformer\u6355\u83b7\u5e8f\u5217\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "result": "\u5728JAADbeh\u548cJAADall\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u523070%\u548c89%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5404\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "conclusion": "ACIT\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u884c\u4eba\u8fc7\u8857\u610f\u56fe\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, high-level reasoning in safety-critical scenarios, where avoiding one traffic risk can create another, remains a major challenge. Such reasoning is often infeasible with only a single front view and requires a comprehensive view of the environment, which we achieve through multi-view inputs. We define Safety-Critical Reasoning as a new task that leverages multi-view inputs to address this challenge. Then, we distill Safety-Critical Reasoning into two stages: first resolve the immediate risk, then mitigate the decision-induced downstream risks. To support this, we introduce WaymoQA, a dataset of 35,000 human-annotated question-answer pairs covering complex, high-risk driving scenarios. The dataset includes multiple-choice and open-ended formats across both image and video modalities.

We observe that although MLLMs can accurately extract visual semantics from visual tokens, they fail to fully leverage this advantage during subsequent inference. To address this limitation, we propose Vision-Guided Attention (VGA), a training-free method that first constructs precise visual grounding by exploiting the semantic content of visual tokens, and then uses this grounding to guide the model's focus toward relevant visual regions. In image captioning, VGA further refines this guidance dynamically during generation by suppressing regions that have already been described. In VGA, each token undergoes only a single forward pass, introducing a negligible latency overhead of just 4.36\\%. In addition, VGA is fully compatible with efficient attention implementations such as FlashAttention. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLMs and multiple hallucination benchmarks demonstrate that VGA achieves state-of-the-art dehallucination performance.

Among existing approaches, point-based methods directly generate point clouds without relying on other representations such as latent features, meshes, or voxels. These methods offer low training cost and algorithmic simplicity, but often underperform compared to representation-based approaches. In this paper, we propose MFM-Point, a multi-scale Flow Matching framework for point cloud generation that substantially improves the scalability and performance of point-based methods while preserving their simplicity and efficiency. Our multi-scale generation algorithm adopts a coarse-to-fine generation paradigm, enhancing generation quality and scalability without incurring additional training or inference overhead. A key challenge in developing such a multi-scale framework lies in preserving the geometric structure of unordered point clouds while ensuring smooth and consistent distributional transitions across resolutions. To address this, we introduce a structured downsampling and upsampling strategy that preserves geometry and maintains alignment between coarse and fine resolutions.

This work presents History-Augmented Contrastive Blind Super-Resolution (HACBSR), an unsupervised framework for blind super-resolution that operates without ground-truth images and external kernel priors. HACBSR comprises two components: (1) a contrastive kernel sampling mechanism with kernel similarity control to mitigate distribution bias from Gaussian sampling, and (2) a history-augmented contrastive learning that uses historical models to generate negative samples to enable less greedy optimization and to induce strong convexity without ground-truth. A convergence analysis of the history-augmented contrastive learning is given in the Appendix. To support evaluation in planetary applications, we introduce Ceres-50, a dataset with diverse geological features simulated degradation patterns. Experiments show that HACBSR achieves competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art unsupervised methods across multiple upscaling factors.

However, balancing compression ratio and reconstruction quality is difficult because low-frequency and high-frequency components contribute differently at the same resolution. To address this, we propose FLaTEC, a frequency-aware compression model that enables the compression of a full scan with high compression ratios. Our approach introduces a frequency-aware mechanism that decouples low-frequency structures and high-frequency textures, while hybridizing latent triplanes as a compact proxy for point cloud. Specifically, we convert voxelized embeddings into triplane representations to reduce sparsity, computational cost, and storage requirements. We then devise a frequency-disentangling technique that extracts compact low-frequency content while collecting high-frequency details across scales. The decoupled low-frequency and high-frequency components are stored in binary format. During decoding, full-spectrum signals are progressively recovered via a modulation block. Additionally, to compensate for the loss of 3D correlation, we introduce an efficient frequency-based attention mechanism that fosters local connectivity and outputs arbitrary resolution points.

Leveraging the generation principle of large language models, they allow for efficiently generating deceptively real-looking images, further increasing the need for reliable detection methods. However, to date there is a lack of work specifically targeting the detection of images generated by AR image generators. In this work, we present PRADA (Probability-Ratio-Based Attribution and Detection of Autoregressive-Generated Images), a simple and interpretable approach that can reliably detect AR-generated images and attribute them to their respective source model. The key idea is to inspect the ratio of a model's conditional and unconditional probability for the autoregressive token sequence representing a given image. Whenever an image is generated by a particular model, its probability ratio shows unique characteristics which are not present for images generated by other models or real images. We exploit these characteristics for threshold-based attribution and detection by calibrating a simple, model-specific score function.

Existing methods typically address this problem by aligning visual content with textual descriptions at the task and step levels to inject procedural semantics into video representations. However, due to their high level of abstraction, 'task' and 'step' descriptions fail to form a robust alignment with the concrete, observable details in visual data. To address this, we introduce 'states', i.e., textual snapshots of object configurations, as a visually-grounded semantic layer that anchors abstract procedures to what a model can actually see. We formalize this insight in a novel Task-Step-State (TSS) framework, where tasks are achieved via steps that drive transitions between observable states. To enforce this structure, we propose a progressive pre-training strategy that unfolds the TSS hierarchy, forcing the model to ground representations in states while associating them with steps and high-level tasks. Extensive experiments on the COIN and CrossTask datasets show that our method outperforms baseline models on multiple downstream tasks, including task recognition, step recognition, and next step prediction. Ablation studies show that introducing state supervision is a key driver of performance gains across all tasks. Additionally, our progressive pretraining strategy proves more effective than standard joint training, as it better enforces the intended hierarchical structure.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Task-Step-State (TSS)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u72b6\u6001\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u8bed\u4e49\u5c42\uff0c\u5c06\u62bd\u8c61\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4e0e\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u7ec6\u8282\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u89c6\u9891\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u6b65\u9aa4\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u5185\u5bb9\u5bf9\u9f50\u6765\u6ce8\u5165\u7a0b\u5e8f\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u9ad8\u5ea6\u62bd\u8c61\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u63cf\u8ff0\u96be\u4ee5\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u7ec6\u8282\u5f62\u6210\u7a33\u5065\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTSS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u9a71\u52a8\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u6362\u7684\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u9010\u6b65\u5c55\u5f00TSS\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5f3a\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u6784\u5efa\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728COIN\u548cCrossTask\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u6b65\u9aa4\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u4e0b\u4e00\u6b65\u9884\u6d4b\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u72b6\u6001\u76d1\u7763\u662f\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f15\u5165\u72b6\u6001\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u8bed\u4e49\u5c42\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u7a0b\u5e8f\u611f\u77e5\u89c6\u9891\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5f3a\u5236\u4e86\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u3002"}}

However, its clinical translation is hindered by inherent challenges: spatially varying noise arising from hardware limitations, and complex imaging protocols introduce heteroscedasticity in CEST data, perturbing the accuracy of quantitative contrast mapping such as amide proton transfer (APT) imaging. Traditional denoising methods are not designed for this complex noise and often alter the underlying information that is critical for biomedical analysis. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new Blind Adaptive Local Denoising (BALD) method. BALD exploits the self-similar nature of CEST data to derive an adaptive variance-stabilizing transform that equalizes the noise distributions across CEST pixels without prior knowledge of noise characteristics. Then, BALD performs two-stage denoising on a linear transformation of data to disentangle molecular signals from noise. A local SVD decomposition is used as a linear transform to prevent spatial and spectral denoising artifacts. We conducted extensive validation experiments on multiple phantoms and \\textit{in vivo} CEST scans.

Many VAD models work without supervision but are still able to provide visual explanations by highlighting the anomalous regions within an image. However, although these visual explanations can be helpful, they lack a direct and semantically meaningful interpretation for users. To address this limitation, we propose extending Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) to the VAD setting. By learning meaningful concepts, the network can provide human-interpretable descriptions of anomalies, offering a novel and more insightful way to explain them. Our contributions are threefold: (i) we develop a Concept Dataset to support research on CBMs for VAD; (ii) we improve the CBM architecture to generate both concept-based and visual explanations, bridging semantic and localization interpretability; and (iii) we introduce a pipeline for synthesizing artificial anomalies, preserving the VAD paradigm of minimizing dependence on rare anomalous samples. Our approach, Concept-Aware Visual Anomaly Detection (CONVAD), achieves performance comparable to classic VAD methods while providing richer, concept-driven explanations that enhance interpretability and trust in VAD systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faCONVAD\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u6982\u5ff5\u74f6\u9888\u6a21\u578b\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u89c6\u89c9\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u6982\u5ff5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f02\u5e38\u533a\u57df\u7684\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u76f4\u63a5\u4e14\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0a\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u4fe1\u4efb\u3002", "method": "\u6269\u5c55\u6982\u5ff5\u74f6\u9888\u6a21\u578b\u5230VAD\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u6982\u5ff5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6539\u8fdbCBM\u67b6\u6784\u751f\u6210\u6982\u5ff5\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u53cc\u91cd\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4eba\u5de5\u5f02\u5e38\u5408\u6210\u7ba1\u9053\u3002", "result": "CONVAD\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178VAD\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u9a71\u52a8\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86VAD\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6982\u5ff5\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5c06\u8bed\u4e49\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4e3aVAD\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002"}}

However, existing approaches often suffer from tight runtime coupling or depend on offline reward signals, resulting in substantial inference overhead or hindering end-to-end optimization. To overcome these limitations, we introduce WPT, a World-to-Policy Transfer training paradigm that enables online distillation under the guidance of an end-to-end world model. Specifically, we develop a trainable reward model that infuses world knowledge into a teacher policy by aligning candidate trajectories with the future dynamics predicted by the world model. Subsequently, we propose policy distillation and world reward distillation to transfer the teacher's reasoning ability into a lightweight student policy, enhancing planning performance while preserving real-time deployability. Extensive experiments on both open-loop and closed-loop benchmarks show that our WPT achieves state-of-the-art performance with a simple policy architecture: it attains a 0.11 collision rate (open-loop) and achieves a 79.23 driving score (closed-loop) surpassing both world-model-based and imitation-learning methods in accuracy and safety.

This article explains an integrated approach to the use of deep learning tools and attention mechanisms for automatic detection of cardiomegaly using X-ray images. The initiation of the project is grounded on a strong Data Collection phase and gathering the data of annotated X-ray images of various types. Then, while the Preprocessing module fine-tunes image quality, it is feasible to utilize the best out of the data quality in the proposed system. In our proposed system, the process is a CNN configuration leveraging the inception V3 model as one of the key blocks. Besides, we also employ a multilayer attention mechanism to enhance the strength. The most important feature of the method is the multi-head attention mechanism that can learn features automatically. By exact selective focusing on only some regions of input, the model can thus identify cardiomegaly in a sensitive manner. Attention rating is calculated, duplicated, and applied to enhance representation of main data, and therefore there is a successful diagnosis. The Evaluation stage will be extremely strict and it will thoroughly evaluate the model based on such measures as accuracy and precision.

As imaging volumes grow, scalable methods that can process entire lung volumes efficiently are essential to tap into the full potential of these large screening datasets. Existing approaches either over-rely on pixel-level annotations, limiting scalability, or analyze the lung in fragments, weakening performance. We present LungEvaty, a fully transformer-based framework for predicting 1-6 year lung cancer risk from a single LDCT scan. The model operates on whole-lung inputs, learning directly from large-scale screening data to capture comprehensive anatomical and pathological cues relevant for malignancy risk. Using only imaging data and no region supervision, LungEvaty matches state-of-the-art performance, refinable by an optional Anatomically Informed Attention Guidance (AIAG) loss that encourages anatomically focused attention. In total, LungEvaty was trained on more than 90,000 CT scans, including over 28,000 for fine-tuning and 6,000 for evaluation.

We identify two failure modes: model-specific periodic content repetition and a universal quality degradation. Prior works attempt to solve repetition via positional encodings, overlooking quality degradation and achieving only limited extrapolation. In this paper, we revisit this challenge from a more fundamental view: attention maps, which directly govern how context influences outputs. We identify that both failure modes arise from a unified cause: attention dispersion, where tokens beyond the training window dilute learned attention patterns. This leads to quality degradation and repetition emerges as a special case when this dispersion becomes structured into periodic attention patterns, induced by harmonic properties of positional encodings. Building on this insight, we propose UltraViCo, a training-free, plug-and-play method that suppresses attention for tokens beyond the training window via a constant decay factor. By jointly addressing both failure modes, we outperform a broad set of baselines largely across models and extrapolation ratios, pushing the extrapolation limit from 2x to 4x. Remarkably, it improves Dynamic Degree and Imaging Quality by 233% and 40.5% over the previous best method at 4x extrapolation. Furthermore, our method generalizes seamlessly to downstream tasks such as controllable video synthesis and editing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faUltraViCo\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6291\u5236\u8d85\u51fa\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a97\u53e3\u7684token\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u89c6\u9891\u957f\u5ea6\u5916\u63a8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c06\u5916\u63a8\u9650\u5236\u4ece2\u500d\u63d0\u5347\u52304\u500d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u89c6\u9891\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u96be\u4ee5\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u8bad\u7ec3\u957f\u5ea6\u4e4b\u5916\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u5468\u671f\u6027\u5185\u5bb9\u91cd\u590d\u548c\u666e\u904d\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u4e24\u79cd\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u5148\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u89e3\u51b3\u91cd\u590d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u4e14\u5916\u63a8\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56fe\u89d2\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u95ee\u9898\u6839\u6e90\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e24\u79cd\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u90fd\u6e90\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u6563\u3002\u63d0\u51faUltraViCo\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6052\u5b9a\u8870\u51cf\u56e0\u5b50\u6291\u5236\u8d85\u51fa\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a97\u53e3\u7684token\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5916\u63a8\u6bd4\u4f8b\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u5e7f\u6cdb\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u5916\u63a8\u9650\u5236\u4ece2\u500d\u63d0\u5347\u52304\u500d\u3002\u57284\u500d\u5916\u63a8\u65f6\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u7a0b\u5ea6\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u522b\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u6700\u4f73\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347233%\u548c40.5%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u89e3\u51b3\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u6563\u95ee\u9898\uff0cUltraViCo\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u957f\u5ea6\u5916\u63a8\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u65e0\u7f1d\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u53ef\u63a7\u89c6\u9891\u5408\u6210\u548c\u7f16\u8f91\u7b49\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

Compared with structural imaging (e.g., X-ray, CT, and MRI), functional PET poses distinct challenges: metabolic patterns vary with tracer physiology, and whole-body 3D contextual information is required rather than local-region interpretation. To advance PETRG, we propose PETRG-3D, an end-to-end 3D dual-branch framework that separately encodes PET and CT volumes and incorporates style-adaptive prompts to mitigate inter-hospital variability in reporting practices. We construct PETRG-Lym, a multi-center lymphoma dataset collected from four hospitals (824 reports w/ 245,509 paired PET/CT slices), and construct AutoPET-RG-Lym, a publicly accessible PETRG benchmark derived from open imaging data but equipped with new expert-written, clinically validated reports (135 cases). To assess clinical utility, we introduce PETRG-Score, a lymphoma-specific evaluation protocol that jointly measures metabolic and structural findings across curated anatomical regions.

To address the challenge of modeling Alzheimers disease (AD) progression from irregularly sampled longitudinal structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (sMRI) data, we propose a Riemannian manifold mapping, a Time-aware manifold Neural ordinary differential equation, and an Attention-based riemannian Gated recurrent unit (R-TNAG) framework. Our approach first projects features extracted from high-dimensional sMRI into a manifold space to preserve the intrinsic geometry of disease progression. On this representation, a time-aware Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (TNODE) models the continuous evolution of latent states between observations, while an Attention-based Riemannian Gated Recurrent Unit (ARGRU) adaptively integrates historical and current information to handle irregular intervals. This joint design improves temporal consistency and yields robust AD trajectory prediction under irregular sampling.Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in both disease status prediction and cognitive score regression. Ablation studies verify the contributions of each module, highlighting their complementary roles in enhancing predictive accuracy. Moreover, the model exhibits stable performance across varying sequence lengths and missing data rates, indicating strong temporal generalizability.

This critical oversight ignores the fact that real-world MLLMs inherently require such mechanisms to mitigate potential risks. In this work, we shift our focus to CVIT for safety-aligned MLLMs and observe that during continual adaptation, the model not only suffers from task forgetting but also exhibits degradation in its safety. Achieving a harmonious balance between safety and task performance remains a crucial challenge. To address this, we propose Harmonious Parameter Adaptation (HPA), a post-training framework composed of focusing-based parameter partition, harmoniously balanced parameter selection, and orthogonal parameter adjustment. Specifically, HPA partitions parameters into two types based on their focus on safety or task performance, and selects the focused ones to preserve from a balanced perspective. In addition, HPA imposes orthogonality constraints on parameter updates to further alleviate catastrophic forgetting.

Existing anomaly detection benchmarks (e.g., MVTec-AD with 15 categories) cover only a narrow range of categories, limiting the evaluation of cross-context generalization and scalability. We introduce ADNet, a large-scale, multi-domain benchmark comprising 380 categories aggregated from 49 publicly available datasets across Electronics, Industry, Agrifood, Infrastructure, and Medical domains. The benchmark includes a total of 196,294 RGB images, consisting of 116,192 normal samples for training and 80,102 test images, of which 60,311 are anomalous. All images are standardized with MVTec-style pixel-level annotations and structured text descriptions spanning both spatial and visual attributes, enabling multimodal anomaly detection tasks. Extensive experiments reveal a clear scalability challenge: existing state-of-the-art methods achieve 90.6% I-AUROC in one-for-one settings but drop to 78.5% when scaling to all 380 categories in a multi-class setting. To address this, we propose Dinomaly-m, a context-guided Mixture-of-Experts extension of Dinomaly that expands decoder capacity without increasing inference cost. It achieves 83.2% I-AUROC and 93.1% P-AUROC, demonstrating superior performance over existing approaches. ADNet is designed as a standardized and extensible benchmark, supporting the community in expanding anomaly detection datasets across diverse domains and providing a scalable foundation for future anomaly detection foundation models.

In this work, we introduce Exo2EgoSyn, an adaptation of WAN 2.2 that unlocks Exocentric-to-Egocentric(Exo2Ego) cross-view video synthesis. Our framework consists of three key modules. Ego-Exo View Alignment(EgoExo-Align) enforces latent-space alignment between exocentric and egocentric first-frame representations, reorienting the generative space from the given exo view toward the ego view. Multi-view Exocentric Video Conditioning (MultiExoCon) aggregates multi-view exocentric videos into a unified conditioning signal, extending WAN2.2 beyond its vanilla single-image or text conditioning. Furthermore, Pose-Aware Latent Injection (PoseInj) injects relative exo-to-ego camera pose information into the latent state, guiding geometry-aware synthesis across viewpoints. Together, these modules enable high-fidelity ego view video generation from third-person observations without retraining from scratch.

This task poses significant challenges, requiring models to accurately perceive and comprehend scene text that varies in scale, orientation, and clarity across frames, while effectively integrating temporal and semantic context to generate precise answers. Moreover, the model must identify question-relevant textual cues and filter out redundant or irrelevant information to ensure answering is guided by the most relevant and informative cues. To address these challenges, we propose SFA, a training-free framework and the first Video-LLM-based method tailored for Video TextVQA, motivated by the human process of answering questions. By adaptively scanning video frames, selectively focusing on key regions, and directly amplifying them, SFA effectively guides the Video-LLM's attention toward essential cues, enabling it to generate more accurate answers.

Its architecture features MSRoPE-BiL, a novel RoPE method with a bi-directionally extendable layer axis for its Diffusion Transformer (DiT) backbone, enabling the concurrent processing of multiple input and target RGBA layers. To power this framework, we introduce AlphaLayers, a new dataset of 1,000 high-quality, multi-layer triplets, built via a novel automated synthesis and filter pipeline. Jointly training OmniAlpha on this dataset across a comprehensive suite of 21 diverse tasks, extensive experiments demonstrate that our unified approach consistently outperforms strong, specialized baselines. Most notably, OmniAlpha achieves a dramatic 84.8% relative reduction in SAD for mask-free matting on AIM-500 and wins over 90% of human preferences in layer-conditioned completion.

Existing methods perform CIG by either fusing objects into specific backgrounds or outpainting the surroundings via foreground object-guided diffusion. However, they often fail to obtain natural results because they overlook the logical relationship between camouflaged objects and background environments. To address this issue, we propose CT-CIG, a Controllable Text-guided Camouflage Images Generation method that produces realistic and logically plausible camouflage images. Leveraging Large Visual Language Models (VLM), we design a Camouflage-Revealing Dialogue Mechanism (CRDM) to annotate existing camouflage datasets with high-quality text prompts. Subsequently, the constructed image-prompt pairs are utilized to finetune Stable Diffusion, incorporating a lightweight controller to guide the location and shape of camouflaged objects for enhanced camouflage scene fitness.

However, existing methods struggle with controllability and fail to precisely manipulate the semantics of specific concepts in the image. We attribute this limitation to semantic entanglement in the patch-token representations on which adversarial attacks typically operate: global context aggregated by self-attention in the vision encoder dominates individual patch features, making them unreliable handles for precise local semantic manipulation. Our systematic investigation reveals a key insight: value features (V) computed within the transformer attention block serve as much more precise handles for manipulation. We show that V suppresses global-context channels, allowing it to retain high-entropy, disentangled local semantic information. Building on this discovery, we propose V-Attack, a novel method designed for precise local semantic attacks. V-Attack targets the value features and introduces two core components: (1) a Self-Value Enhancement module to refine V's intrinsic semantic richness, and (2) a Text-Guided Value Manipulation module that leverages text prompts to locate source concept and optimize it toward a target concept. By bypassing the entangled patch features, V-Attack achieves highly effective semantic control. Extensive experiments across diverse LVLMs, including LLaVA, InternVL, DeepseekVL and GPT-4o, show that V-Attack improves the attack success rate by an average of 36% over state-of-the-art methods, exposing critical vulnerabilities in modern visual-language understanding.

These models are typically data-intensive, a challenge that becomes more pronounced when dealing with diverse and complex images. In this work, we propose HistoSpeckle-Net, a deep learning architecture designed to reconstruct structurally rich medical images from MMF speckles. To build a clinically relevant dataset, we develop an optical setup that couples laser light through a spatial light modulator (SLM) into an MMF, capturing output speckle patterns corresponding to input OrganAMNIST images. Unlike previous MMF imaging approaches, which have not considered the underlying statistics of speckles and reconstructed images, we introduce a distribution-aware learning strategy. We employ a histogram-based mutual information loss to enhance model robustness and reduce reliance on large datasets. Our model includes a histogram computation unit that estimates smooth marginal and joint histograms for calculating mutual information loss. It also incorporates a unique Three-Scale Feature Refinement Module, which leads to multiscale Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) loss computation. Together, these two loss functions enhance both the structural fidelity and statistical alignment of the reconstructed images. Our experiments on the complex OrganAMNIST dataset demonstrate that HistoSpeckle-Net achieves higher fidelity than baseline models such as U-Net and Pix2Pix. It gives superior performance even with limited training samples and across varying fiber bending conditions.

However, how these models behave under long prompts remains underexplored. Long prompts encode rich content, spatial, and stylistic information that enhances fidelity but often suppresses diversity, leading to repetitive and less creative outputs. In this work, we systematically study this fidelity-diversity dilemma and reveal that state-of-the-art models exhibit a clear drop in diversity as prompt length increases. To enable consistent evaluation, we introduce LPD-Bench, a benchmark designed for assessing both fidelity and diversity in long-prompt generation. Building on our analysis, we develop a theoretical framework that increases sampling entropy through prompt reformulation and propose a training-free method, PromptMoG, which samples prompt embeddings from a Mixture-of-Gaussians in the embedding space to enhance diversity while preserving semantics. Extensive experiments on four state-of-the-art models, SD3.5-Large, Flux.1-Krea-Dev, CogView4, and Qwen-Image, demonstrate that PromptMoG consistently improves long-prompt generation diversity without semantic drifting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u957f\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u5bfc\u81f4\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86LPD-Bench\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u548cPromptMoG\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u9ad8\u65af\u91c7\u6837\u589e\u5f3a\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u957f\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u957f\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u867d\u7136\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4f46\u6291\u5236\u4e86\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8f93\u51fa\u91cd\u590d\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u521b\u610f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86PromptMoG\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u5d4c\u5165\u8fdb\u884c\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u52a0\u91c7\u6837\u71b5\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728SD3.5-Large\u3001Flux.1-Krea-Dev\u3001CogView4\u548cQwen-Image\u56db\u4e2a\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPromptMoG\u80fd\u4e00\u81f4\u5730\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u751f\u6210\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\u3002", "conclusion": "PromptMoG\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u89e3\u51b3\u957f\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Real-world environments demand models capable of recognizing diverse, previously unseen objects, which remains a major limitation of closed-set methods. Existing open-vocabulary 3D detectors relax annotation requirements but still depend on training scenes, either as point clouds or images. We take this a step further by introducing Zoo3D, the first training-free 3D object detection framework. Our method constructs 3D bounding boxes via graph clustering of 2D instance masks, then assigns semantic labels using a novel open-vocabulary module with best-view selection and view-consensus mask generation. Zoo3D operates in two modes: the zero-shot Zoo3D$_0$, which requires no training at all, and the self-supervised Zoo3D$_1$, which refines 3D box prediction by training a class-agnostic detector on Zoo3D$_0$-generated pseudo labels. Furthermore, we extend Zoo3D beyond point clouds to work directly with posed and even unposed images. Across ScanNet200 and ARKitScenes benchmarks, both Zoo3D$_0$ and Zoo3D$_1$ achieve state-of-the-art results in open-vocabulary 3D object detection. Remarkably, our zero-shot Zoo3D$_0$ outperforms all existing self-supervised methods, hence demonstrating the power and adaptability of training-free, off-the-shelf approaches for real-world 3D understanding.

Most current RL approaches depend on pre-trained preference models that output scalar rewards to approximate human preferences. However, these rewards often fail to capture human perception and are vulnerable to reward hacking, where higher scores do not correspond to better images. To address this, we introduce Adv-GRPO, an RL framework with an adversarial reward that iteratively updates both the reward model and the generator. The reward model is supervised using reference images as positive samples and can largely avoid being hacked. Unlike KL regularization that constrains parameter updates, our learned reward directly guides the generator through its visual outputs, leading to higher-quality images. Moreover, while optimizing existing reward functions can alleviate reward hacking, their inherent biases remain. For instance, PickScore may degrade image quality, whereas OCR-based rewards often reduce aesthetic fidelity. To address this, we take the image itself as a reward, using reference images and vision foundation models (e.g., DINO) to provide rich visual rewards. These dense visual signals, instead of a single scalar, lead to consistent gains across image quality, aesthetics, and task-specific metrics. Finally, we show that combining reference samples with foundation-model rewards enables distribution transfer and flexible style customization. In human evaluation, our method outperforms Flow-GRPO and SD3, achieving 70.0% and 72.4% win rates in image quality and aesthetics, respectively.

However, applying WA directly to multi-modal domain generalization (MMDG) is challenging: differences in optimization speed across modalities lead WA to overfit to faster-converging ones in early stages, suppressing the contribution of slower yet complementary modalities, thereby hindering effective modality fusion and skewing the loss surface toward sharper, less generalizable minima. To address this issue, we propose MBCD, a unified collaborative distillation framework that retains WA's flatness-inducing advantages while overcoming its shortcomings in multi-modal contexts. MBCD begins with adaptive modality dropout in the student model to curb early-stage bias toward dominant modalities. A gradient consistency constraint then aligns learning signals between uni-modal branches and the fused representation, encouraging coordinated and smoother optimization. Finally, a WA-based teacher conducts cross-modal distillation by transferring fused knowledge to each uni-modal branch, which strengthens cross-modal interactions and steer convergence toward flatter solutions.

Conventional classification approaches typically train models to directly predict class labels from input images, but this might lead to suboptimal performance in such scenarios. To address this issue, we propose Discrete Diffusion Classification Modeling (DiDiCM), a novel framework that leverages a diffusion-based procedure to model the posterior distribution of class labels conditioned on the input image. DiDiCM supports diffusion-based predictions either on class probabilities or on discrete class labels, providing flexibility in computation and memory trade-offs. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study demonstrating the superior performance of DiDiCM over standard classifiers, showing that a few diffusion iterations achieve higher classification accuracy on the ImageNet dataset compared to baselines, with accuracy gains increasing as the task becomes more challenging.

Most existing methods rely on unsupervised reconstruction using only normal data, often resulting in overfitting and poor detection of subtle defects. We propose a semi-supervised deep reinforcement learning framework that integrates a neural batch sampler, an autoencoder, and a predictor. The RL-based sampler adaptively selects informative patches by balancing exploration and exploitation through a composite reward. The autoencoder generates loss profiles highlighting abnormal regions, while the predictor performs segmentation in the loss-profile space. This interaction enables the system to effectively learn both normal and defective patterns with limited labeled data. Experiments on the MVTec AD dataset demonstrate that our method achieves higher accuracy and better localization of subtle anomalies than recent state-of-the-art approaches while maintaining low complexity, yielding an average improvement of 0.15 in F1_max and 0.06 in AUC, with a maximum gain of 0.37 in F1_max in the best case.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5de5\u4e1a\u89c6\u89c9\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91c7\u6837\u3001\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u534f\u540c\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u7ec6\u5fae\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "motivation": "\u5de5\u4e1a\u89c6\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7f3a\u9677\u6837\u672c\u7a00\u7f3a\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bb9\u6613\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u68c0\u6d4b\u7ec6\u5fae\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9009\u62e9\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5757\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u751f\u6210\u635f\u5931\u5206\u5e03\u56fe\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u5728\u635f\u5931\u5206\u5e03\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u5272\u3002", "result": "\u5728MVTec AD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5F1_max\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u53470.15\uff0cAUC\u63d0\u53470.06\uff0c\u6700\u4f73\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0bF1_max\u63d0\u53470.37\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u6709\u9650\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u5b66\u4e60\u6b63\u5e38\u548c\u7f3a\u9677\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u7ec6\u5fae\u5f02\u5e38\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

This high-level vision-grounded semantics, which we term visual knowledge, forms a bridge between perception and reasoning, yet remains an underexplored area in current MLLMs. To systematically evaluate this capability, we present VKnowU, a comprehensive benchmark featuring 1,680 questions in 1,249 videos, covering 8 core types of visual knowledge spanning both world-centric (e.g., intuitive physics) and human-centric (e.g., subjective intentions). Evaluation of 23 SOTA MLLMs reveals that leading models still fall short of human performance, with particularly notable gaps in the world-centric. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new dataset, VKnowQA, and VideoKnow+, a baseline model that explicitly incorporates visual knowledge into MLLMs. VideoKnow+ follows a structured See-Think-Answer paradigm and adopts reinforcement learning with visual knowledge reward, achieving a +3.7% improvement on VKnowU and consistent gains on MVBench, Video-MME, and MMVU. Our work highlights visual knowledge as a missing cornerstone for developing more generalizable MLLMs that can not only see but also truly understand our physical and social worlds.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86VKnowU\u57fa\u51c6\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u77e5\u8bc6\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7269\u7406\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u539f\u7406\u7406\u89e3\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86VideoKnow+\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u8fd9\u4e00\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u64c5\u957f\u7269\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e16\u754c\u7269\u7406\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u539f\u7406\u7684\u76f4\u89c2\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u89c6\u89c9\u77e5\u8bc6\u80fd\u529b\u662f\u8fde\u63a5\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5173\u952e\u73af\u8282\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86VKnowU\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b1,680\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u548c1,249\u4e2a\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u6db5\u76d68\u79cd\u6838\u5fc3\u89c6\u89c9\u77e5\u8bc6\u7c7b\u578b\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86VideoKnow+\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528See-Think-Answer\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u77e5\u8bc6\u5956\u52b1\u8fdb\u884c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f3023\u4e2a\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u9886\u5148\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u8fbe\u4e0d\u5230\u4eba\u7c7b\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u5fc3\u578b\u77e5\u8bc6\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u8ddd\uff1bVideoKnow+\u5728VKnowU\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86+3.7%\u7684\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89c6\u89c9\u77e5\u8bc6\u662f\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u5177\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u57fa\u77f3\uff0c\u8fd9\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u770b\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u771f\u6b63\u7406\u89e3\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7269\u7406\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u4e16\u754c\u3002"}}

The same holds for retrieving the image embedding (image retrieval task) given a text prompt. However, real-world scene images exhibit rich compositional structure involving multiple objects and actions. The latest methods in the CLIP-based literature improve class-level discrimination by mining harder negative image-text pairs and by refining permanent text prompts, often using LLMs. However, these improvements remain confined to predefined class lists and do not explicitly model relational or compositional structure. PyramidCLIP partially addresses this gap by aligning global and local visual features, yet it still lacks explicit modeling of inter-object relations. Hence, to further leverage this aspect for scene analysis, the proposed ScenarioCLIP model accepts input texts, grounded relations, and input images, along with focused regions highlighting relations. The proposed model is pretrained on curated scenario data, and finetuned for specialized downstream tasks, such as cross-modal retrieval and fine-grained visual understanding tasks. To address the lack of domain-specific datasets, we generate a novel dataset by extending image-text pairs from existing diverse indoor and outdoor scenario datasets that are publicly available. We used a pipeline of existing language models to ground action, object, and relations, filled by manual and automatic curation. We established a comprehensive benchmark for several scenario-based tasks and compared it with many baseline methods.

However, existing specialized PEFT methods often fail when applied to large-scale Earth observation tasks, as they are unable to fully handle the multifaceted and unpredictable domain gaps (\\eg, spatial, semantic, and frequency shifts) inherent in RS data. To overcome this, we propose CrossEarth-Gate, which introduces two primary contributions. First, we establish a comprehensive RS module toolbox to address multifaceted domain gaps, comprising spatial, semantic, and frequency modules. Second, we develop a Fisher-guided adaptive selection mechanism that operates on this toolbox. This selection is guided by Fisher Information to quantify each module's importance by measuring its contribution to the task-specific gradient flow.

However, when applied to image-to-image translation, they still depend on costly multi-step denoising, hindering real-time applications. Although the recent adversarial training paradigm, CycleGAN-Turbo, works in pretrained diffusion models for one-step image translation, we find that directly applying it to RF models leads to severe convergence issues. In this paper, we analyze these challenges and propose TReFT, a novel method to Tame Rectified Flow models for one-step image Translation. Unlike previous works, TReFT directly uses the velocity predicted by pretrained DiT or UNet as output-a simple yet effective design that tackles the convergence issues under adversarial training with one-step inference. This design is mainly motivated by a novel observation that, near the end of the denoising process, the velocity predicted by pretrained RF models converges to the vector from origin to the final clean image, a property we further justify through theoretical analysis. When applying TReFT to large pretrained RF models such as SD3.5 and FLUX, we introduce memory-efficient latent cycle-consistency and identity losses during training, as well as lightweight architectural simplifications for faster inference. Pretrained RF models finetuned with TReFT achieve performance comparable to sota methods across multiple image translation datasets while enabling real-time inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "TReFT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9a6f\u5316\u6574\u6d41\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e00\u6b65\u56fe\u50cf\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6574\u6d41\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u8981\u591a\u6b65\u53bb\u566a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u6574\u6d41\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4ecd\u4f9d\u8d56\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u591a\u6b65\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5230\u6574\u6d41\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u6536\u655b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "TReFT\u76f4\u63a5\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3DiT\u6216UNet\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u4f46\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5728\u4e00\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u4e0b\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6536\u655b\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u89c2\u5bdf\uff1a\u5728\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u63a5\u8fd1\u7ed3\u675f\u65f6\uff0c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3RF\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u6536\u655b\u5230\u4ece\u539f\u70b9\u5230\u6700\u7ec8\u5e72\u51c0\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5411\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5f53\u5c06TReFT\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3RF\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982SD3.5\u548cFLUX\uff09\u65f6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u5185\u5b58\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5faa\u73af\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u8eab\u4efd\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u67b6\u6784\u7b80\u5316\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5feb\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u7ecf\u8fc7TReFT\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3RF\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u56fe\u50cf\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "TReFT\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6574\u6d41\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e2d\u7684\u6536\u655b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u4e00\u6b65\u56fe\u50cf\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While deep learning-based encoder-decoder frameworks have advanced the field, their static pattern learning suffers from pattern drift across diverse scenarios (\\emph{e.g.}, day/night variations, sky/maritime/ground domains), limiting robustness. To address this, we propose IrisNet, a novel meta-learned framework that dynamically adapts detection strategies to the input infrared image status. Our approach establishes a dynamic mapping between infrared image features and entire decoder parameters via an image-to-decoder transformer. More concretely, we represent the parameterized decoder as a structured 2D tensor preserving hierarchical layer correlations and enable the transformer to model inter-layer dependencies through self-attention while generating adaptive decoding patterns via cross-attention. To further enhance the perception ability of infrared images, we integrate high-frequency components to supplement target-position and scene-edge information.

Instead of passive feature extraction, this strategy enables a dynamic process of knowledge recollection, where long-term memory is adapted to the specific context of the current image, significantly enhancing localization accuracy and robustness.

To address these limitations, we propose VGGTFace, an automatic approach that innovatively applies the 3D foundation model, \\emph{i.e.} VGGT, for topologically consistent facial geometry reconstruction from in-the-wild multi-view images captured by everyday users. Our key insight is that, by leveraging VGGT, our method naturally inherits strong generalization ability and expressive power from its large-scale training and point map representation. However, it is unclear how to reconstruct a topologically consistent mesh from VGGT, as the topology information is missing in its prediction. To this end, we augment VGGT with Pixel3DMM for injecting topology information via pixel-aligned UV values. In this manner, we convert the pixel-aligned point map of VGGT to a point cloud with topology. Tailored to this point cloud with known topology, we propose a novel Topology-Aware Bundle Adjustment strategy to fuse them, where we construct a Laplacian energy for the Bundle Adjustment objective.

Recent speculative inference methods enable lossless parallel sampling in U-Net-based diffusion models via a drafter-verifier scheme, but their acceleration is limited on DiTs due to insufficient draft accuracy during verification. To address this limitation, we analyze the DiTs' feature dynamics and find the features of the final transformer layer (top-block) exhibit strong temporal consistency and rich semantic abstraction. Based on this insight, we propose FREE, a novel framework that employs a lightweight drafter to perform feature-level autoregression with parallel verification, guaranteeing lossless acceleration with theoretical and empirical support. Meanwhile, prediction variance (uncertainty) of DiTs naturally increases in later denoising steps, reducing acceptance rates under speculative sampling. To mitigate this effect, we further introduce an uncertainty-guided relaxation strategy, forming FREE (relax), which dynamically adjusts the acceptance probability in response to uncertainty levels. Experiments on ImageNet-$512^2$ show that FREE achieves up to $1.86 \\times$ acceleration, and FREE (relax) further reaches $2.25 \\times$ speedup while maintaining high perceptual and quantitative fidelity in generation quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "FREE\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668(DiTs)\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u7ea7\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u5e76\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u635f\u52a0\u901f\uff0cFREE (relax)\u7248\u672c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5f15\u5165\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u677e\u5f1b\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728ImageNet-512\u00b2\u4e0a\u8fbe\u52302.25\u500d\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "motivation": "DiTs\u867d\u7136\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u4f18\u79c0\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u53bb\u566a\u8f68\u8ff9\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u63a8\u6d4b\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728DiTs\u4e0a\u52a0\u901f\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u8349\u7a3f\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "1. \u5206\u6790DiTs\u7279\u5f81\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9876\u5c42\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u7279\u5f81\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u4e30\u5bcc\u8bed\u4e49\u62bd\u8c61\uff1b2. \u63d0\u51faFREE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8349\u7a3f\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u7279\u5f81\u7ea7\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u5e76\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1b3. \u5f15\u5165\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u677e\u5f1b\u7b56\u7565(FREE relax)\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u63a5\u53d7\u6982\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5728ImageNet-512\u00b2\u4e0a\uff0cFREE\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u9ad81.86\u500d\u52a0\u901f\uff0cFREE (relax)\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8fbe\u52302.25\u500d\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u9ad8\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u5b9a\u91cf\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "FREE\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u7ea7\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u677e\u5f1b\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86DiTs\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65e0\u635f\u52a0\u901f\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Given the ID images of multiple individuals, its purpose is to generate a customized image that seamlessly integrates them while preserving their respective identities. Compared to single-ID customization, multi-ID customization is much more difficult and poses two major challenges. First, since the multi-ID customization model is trained to reconstruct an image from the cropped person regions, it often encounters the copy-paste issue during inference, leading to lower quality. Second, the model also suffers from inferior text controllability. The generated result simply combines multiple persons into one image, regardless of whether it is aligned with the input text. In this work, we propose MultiID to tackle this challenging task in a training-free manner. Since the existing single-ID customization models have less copy-paste issue, our key idea is to adapt these models to achieve multi-ID customization. To this end, we present an ID-decoupled cross-attention mechanism, injecting distinct ID embeddings into the corresponding image regions and thus generating multi-ID outputs. To enhance the generation controllability, we introduce three critical strategies, namely the local prompt, depth-guided spatial control, and extended self-attention, making the results more consistent with the text prompts and ID images. We also carefully build a benchmark, called IDBench, for evaluation. The extensive qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of MultiID in solving the aforementioned two challenges.

The Consistency Model (CM), as a trajectory-based framework, demonstrates significant potential due to its strong theoretical foundation and high-quality few-step generation. Nevertheless, current continuous-time consistency distillation methods still rely heavily on training data and computational resources, hindering their deployment in resource-constrained scenarios and limiting their scalability to diverse domains. To address this issue, we propose Trajectory-Backward Consistency Model (TBCM), which eliminates the dependence on external training data by extracting latent representations directly from the teacher model's generation trajectory. Unlike conventional methods that require VAE encoding and large-scale datasets, our self-contained distillation paradigm significantly improves both efficiency and simplicity. Moreover, the trajectory-extracted samples naturally bridge the distribution gap between training and inference, thereby enabling more effective knowledge transfer. Empirically, TBCM achieves 6.52 FID and 28.08 CLIP scores on MJHQ-30k under one-step generation, while reducing training time by approximately 40% compared to Sana-Sprint and saving a substantial amount of GPU memory, demonstrating superior efficiency without sacrificing quality. We further reveal the diffusion-generation space discrepancy in continuous-time consistency distillation and analyze how sampling strategies affect distillation performance, offering insights for future distillation research.

Block Cascading significantly mitigates this trade-off through training-free parallelization. Our key insight: future video blocks do not need fully denoised current blocks to begin generation. By starting block generation with partially denoised context from predecessors, we transform sequential pipelines into parallel cascades where multiple blocks denoise simultaneously. With 5 GPUs exploiting temporal parallelism, we achieve ~2x acceleration across all model scales: 1.3B models accelerate from 16 to 30 FPS, 14B models from 4.5 to 12.5 FPS. Beyond inference speed, Block Cascading eliminates overhead from KV-recaching (of ~200ms) during context switches for interactive generation. Extensive evaluations validated against multiple block-causal pipelines demonstrate no significant loss in generation quality when switching from block-causal to Block Cascading pipelines for inference.

To address this, BRIC dynamically adapts the physics controller to noisy motion plans at test time, while preserving pre-trained skills via a loss function that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. In addition, BRIC introduces a lightweight test-time guidance mechanism that steers the diffusion model in the signal space without updating its parameters. By combining both adaptation strategies, BRIC ensures consistent and physically plausible long-term executions across diverse environments in an effective and efficient manner.

Our OC-VTP requires merely light-weight pre-training of a small object-centric vision token pruner, which can then be inserted into existing VLMs, without fine-tuning of any models on any datasets. It is gauranteed that the most representative vision tokens are kept by minimizing the error in reconstructing the original unpruned tokens from the selected ones. Across any vision pruning ratios, i.e., inference efficiency, our OC-VTP consistently helps mainstream VLMs to preserve the highest inference accuracy.

To enable machines to understand such complex, context-dependent behaviors, it is essential to model multiple people in relation to the surrounding scene context. In this paper, we present a novel research problem to model the correlations between two people engaged in a shared interaction involving an object. We refer to this formulation as Human-Human-Object Interactions (HHOIs). To overcome the lack of dedicated datasets for HHOIs, we present a newly captured HHOIs dataset and a method to synthesize HHOI data by leveraging image generative models. As an intermediary, we obtain individual human-object interaction (HOIs) and human-human interaction (HHIs) from the HHOIs, and with these data, we train an text-to-HOI and text-to-HHI model using score-based diffusion model. Finally, we present a unified generative framework that integrates the two individual model, capable of synthesizing complete HHOIs in a single advanced sampling process. Our method extends HHOI generation to multi-human settings, enabling interactions involving more than two individuals. Experimental results show that our method generates realistic HHOIs conditioned on textual descriptions, outperforming previous approaches that focus only on single-human HOIs.

However, current remote sensing foundation models are ill-suited to such inputs: full-image encoding exhausts token and memory budgets, while resize-based preprocessing loses fine-grained and answer-critical details. In this context, guiding the model look where it matters before prediction becomes crucial. Therefore, we present ZoomSearch, a training-free, plug-and-play pipeline that decouples 'where to look' from 'how to answer' for Ultra-HR Remote Sensing Visual Question Answering (RS-VQA). ZoomSearch combines Adaptive Multi-Branch Zoom Search, which performs a hierarchical search over image patches to localize query-relevant regions, with Layout-Aware Patch Reassembly, which reorganizes the selected patches into a compact, layout-faithful canvas. We conduct comprehensive experiments on Ultra-HR RS-VQA benchmarks MME-RealWorld-RS and LRS-VQA, comparing against (i) strong general foundation models, (ii) remote sensing foundation models, (iii) Ultra-HR RS-VQA methods, and (iv) plug-and-play search-based VQA methods. When integrated with LLaVA-ov, ZoomSearch attains state-of-the-art accuracy across diverse tasks, improving the LLaVA-ov baseline by 26.3% on LRS-VQA and 114.8\\% on MME-RealWorld-RS.

Yet in the video generation domain, where spatiotemporal complexity and computational cost are substantially higher, state-of-the-art systems almost exclusively rely on diffusion-based models. In this work, we revisit this design space by presenting STARFlow-V, a normalizing flow-based video generator with substantial benefits such as end-to-end learning, robust causal prediction, and native likelihood estimation. Building upon the recently proposed STARFlow, STARFlow-V operates in the spatiotemporal latent space with a global-local architecture which restricts causal dependencies to a global latent space while preserving rich local within-frame interactions. This eases error accumulation over time, a common pitfall of standard autoregressive diffusion model generation. Additionally, we propose flow-score matching, which equips the model with a light-weight causal denoiser to improve the video generation consistency in an autoregressive fashion. To improve the sampling efficiency, STARFlow-V employs a video-aware Jacobi iteration scheme that recasts inner updates as parallelizable iterations without breaking causality. Thanks to the invertible structure, the same model can natively support text-to-video, image-to-video as well as video-to-video generation tasks. Empirically, STARFlow-V achieves strong visual fidelity and temporal consistency with practical sampling throughput relative to diffusion-based baselines.

Identifying and distinguishing dance genres based on motion data is a complex problem in human activity recognition, as many styles share similar poses, gestures, and temporal motion patterns. This work presents a lightweight framework for classifying dance styles that determines motion characteristics based on pose estimates extracted from videos. We propose temporal-spatial descriptors inspired by Laban Movement Analysis. These features capture local joint dynamics such as velocity, acceleration, and angular movement of the upper body, enabling a structured representation of spatial coordination. To further encode rhythmic and periodic aspects of movement, we integrate Fast Fourier Transform features that characterize movement patterns in the frequency domain.

Bigham", "Jason Wu"], "title": "DesignPref: Capturing Personal Preferences in Visual Design Generation", "comment": null, "summary": "Generative models, such as large language models and text-to-image diffusion models, are increasingly used to create visual designs like user interfaces (UIs) and presentation slides. Finetuning and benchmarking these generative models have often relied on datasets of human-annotated design preferences. Yet, due to the subjective and highly personalized nature of visual design, preference varies widely among individuals. In this paper, we study this problem by introducing DesignPref, a dataset of 12k pairwise comparisons of UI design generation annotated by 20 professional designers with multi-level preference ratings. We found that among trained designers, substantial levels of disagreement exist (Krippendorff's alpha = 0.25 for binary preferences). Natural language rationales provided by these designers indicate that disagreements stem from differing perceptions of various design aspect importance and individual preferences. With DesignPref, we demonstrate that traditional majority-voting methods for training aggregated judge models often do not accurately reflect individual preferences. To address this challenge, we investigate multiple personalization strategies, particularly fine-tuning or incorporating designer-specific annotations into RAG pipelines. Our results show that personalized models consistently outperform aggregated baseline models in predicting individual designers' preferences, even when using 20 times fewer examples.

However, recent advanced methods such as BAGEL and LMFusion follow the Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) paradigm, adopting a symmetric design that mirrors one expert to another for convenient initialization and fusion, which remains suboptimal due to inherent modality discrepancies. In this work, we propose HBridge, an asymmetric H-shaped architecture that enables heterogeneous experts to optimally leverage pretrained priors from their respective modality domains. Unlike prior dense fusion strategies that straightforwardly connect all layers between experts via shared attention, HBridge selectively bridges intermediate layers, reducing over 40% attention sharing, which improves efficiency and enhances generation quality. Shallow and deep layers, which capture modality-specific representations, are decoupled, while mid-layer bridging promotes semantic alignment. To further strengthen cross-modal coherence, we introduce semantic reconstruction tokens that explicitly guide the generative expert to reconstruct visual semantic tokens of the target image. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance of HBridge, establishing a new paradigm for unified multimodal generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "HBridge\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u7684H\u5f62\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6865\u63a5\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u5f02\u6784\u4e13\u5bb6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5171\u4eab\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982BAGEL\u548cLMFusion\uff09\u7531\u4e8e\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\u800c\u5b58\u5728\u6b21\u4f18\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528H\u5f62\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6865\u63a5\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\uff0c\u51cf\u5c1140%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5171\u4eab\uff1b\u6d45\u5c42\u548c\u6df1\u5c42\u89e3\u8026\u4ee5\u4fdd\u7559\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5b9a\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4e2d\u5c42\u6865\u63a5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u8bed\u4e49\u91cd\u5efa\u4ee4\u724c\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86HBridge\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "HBridge\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6865\u63a5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Unlike prior mistake understanding work, which lacks fine-grained output, MATT concretely attributes mistakes to the input instruction text or the attempt video. MATT determines what part of the instruction is violated (semantic role), when the deviation becomes irreversible (the Point-of-No-Return, PNR), and where the mistake appears in the PNR frame. We develop MisEngine, a data engine that automatically constructs attribution-rich mistake samples from existing datasets and inherits their annotations. Applied to large egocentric corpora, MisEngine yields EPIC-KITCHENS-M and Ego4D-M, two datasets that are up to two orders of magnitude larger than prior mistake datasets. We then present MisFormer, a unified attention-based model for mistake attribution across semantic (what), temporal (when), and spatial (where) dimensions, trained using MisEngine supervision. Experiments on our new datasets and prior benchmarks show that MisFormer outperforms strong video-language, temporal localization, hand-object interaction, and mistake-detection baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Mistake Attribution (MATT)\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7406\u89e3\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7MisEngine\u6570\u636e\u5f15\u64ce\u81ea\u52a8\u6784\u5efa\u9519\u8bef\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u521b\u5efa\u4e86EPIC-KITCHENS-M\u548cEgo4D-M\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684MisFormer\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u9519\u8bef\u5f52\u56e0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u7406\u89e3\u5de5\u4f5c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5177\u4f53\u5c06\u9519\u8bef\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u8f93\u5165\u6307\u4ee4\u6587\u672c\u6216\u5c1d\u8bd5\u89c6\u9891\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u786e\u5b9a\u6307\u4ee4\u54ea\u90e8\u5206\u88ab\u8fdd\u53cd\u3001\u4f55\u65f6\u504f\u79bb\u53d8\u5f97\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u4ee5\u53ca\u9519\u8bef\u51fa\u73b0\u5728\u54ea\u91cc\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86MisEngine\u6570\u636e\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u4ece\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u81ea\u52a8\u6784\u5efa\u5177\u6709\u4e30\u5bcc\u5f52\u56e0\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u6837\u672c\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MisFormer\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u9519\u8bef\u5f52\u56e0\u3002", "result": "MisEngine\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u9519\u8bef\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5927\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff1bMisFormer\u5728\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3001\u624b\u7269\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u68c0\u6d4b\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "MATT\u4efb\u52a1\u548cMisEngine/MisFormer\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u9519\u8bef\u7406\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Timestep distillation is a promising technique to accelerate generation, but it often requires extensive training and leads to image quality degradation. Furthermore, fine-tuning these distilled models for specific objectives, such as aesthetic appeal or user preference, using Reinforcement Learning (RL) is notoriously unstable and easily falls into reward hacking. In this work, we introduce Flash-DMD, a novel framework that enables fast convergence with distillation and joint RL-based refinement. Specifically, we first propose an efficient timestep-aware distillation strategy that significantly reduces training cost with enhanced realism, outperforming DMD2 with only $2.1\\%$ its training cost. Second, we introduce a joint training scheme where the model is fine-tuned with an RL objective while the timestep distillation training continues simultaneously. We demonstrate that the stable, well-defined loss from the ongoing distillation acts as a powerful regularizer, effectively stabilizing the RL training process and preventing policy collapse. Extensive experiments on score-based and flow matching models show that our proposed Flash-DMD not only converges significantly faster but also achieves state-of-the-art generation quality in the few-step sampling regime, outperforming existing methods in visual quality, human preference, and text-image alignment metrics.

From Analysis to Path Forward", "comment": null, "summary": "Recent years have witnessed significant progress in Unified Multimodal Models, yet a fundamental question remains: Does understanding truly inform generation? To investigate this, we introduce UniSandbox, a decoupled evaluation framework paired with controlled, synthetic datasets to avoid data leakage and enable detailed analysis. Our findings reveal a significant understanding-generation gap, which is mainly reflected in two key dimensions: reasoning generation and knowledge transfer. Specifically, for reasoning generation tasks, we observe that explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) in the understanding module effectively bridges the gap, and further demonstrate that a self-training approach can successfully internalize this ability, enabling implicit reasoning during generation. Additionally, for knowledge transfer tasks, we find that CoT assists the generative process by helping retrieve newly learned knowledge, and also discover that query-based architectures inherently exhibit latent CoT-like properties that affect this transfer. UniSandbox provides preliminary insights for designing future unified architectures and training strategies that truly bridge the gap between understanding and generation.

We train ReaDe via a two-stage optimization: (i) reasoning-augmented supervision imparts analytic parsing with stepwise traces and dense captions, and (ii) a multi-dimensional reward assigner enables stable, feedback-driven refinement for natural-style captions. Experiments across single- and multi-condition scenarios show consistent gains in instruction fidelity, caption accuracy, and downstream video quality, with strong generalization to reasoning-intensive and unseen inputs.

However, existing tokenizers are typically trained from scratch and struggle to balance semantic representation and reconstruction fidelity, particularly in high-dimensional latent spaces. In this work, we introduce DINO-Tok, a DINO-based visual tokenizer that unifies hierarchical representations into an information-complete latent space. By integrating shallow features that retain fine-grained details with deep features encoding global semantics, DINO-Tok effectively bridges pretrained representations and visual generation. We further analyze the challenges of vector quantization (VQ) in this high-dimensional space, where key information is often lost and codebook collapse occurs. We thus propose a global PCA reweighting mechanism to stabilize VQ and preserve essential information across dimensions. On ImageNet 256$\\times$256, DINO-Tok achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance, reaching 28.54 PSNR for autoencoding and 23.98 PSNR for VQ-based modeling, significantly outperforming prior tokenizers and comparable to billion-level data trained models (such as Hunyuan and Wan).

A promising path forward is high-fidelity simulation that combines photorealistic sensor rendering with geometrically grounded interaction in complex, open-world urban environments. Although recent video-3DGS methods ease open-world scene capturing, they are still unsuitable for benchmarking due to large visual and geometric sim-to-real gaps. To address these challenges, we introduce Wanderland, a real-to-sim framework that features multi-sensor capture, reliable reconstruction, accurate geometry, and robust view synthesis. Using this pipeline, we curate a diverse dataset of indoor-outdoor urban scenes and systematically demonstrate how image-only pipelines scale poorly, how geometry quality impacts novel view synthesis, and how all of these adversely affect navigation policy learning and evaluation reliability. Beyond serving as a trusted testbed for embodied navigation, Wanderland's rich raw sensor data further allows benchmarking of 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis models.

While these models excel at temporal coherence, their dynamics are often constrained by the continuous nature of their training data. We hypothesize that by injecting the rich and unconstrained content diversity from image data into this coherent temporal framework, we can generate image sets that feature both natural transitions and a far more expansive dynamic range. To this end, we introduce iMontage, a unified framework designed to repurpose a powerful video model into an all-in-one image generator. The framework consumes and produces variable-length image sets, unifying a wide array of image generation and editing tasks. To achieve this, we propose an elegant and minimally invasive adaptation strategy, complemented by a tailored data curation process and training paradigm. This approach allows the model to acquire broad image manipulation capabilities without corrupting its invaluable original motion priors. iMontage excels across several mainstream many-in-many-out tasks, not only maintaining strong cross-image contextual consistency but also generating scenes with extraordinary dynamics that surpass conventional scopes.

To answer this question, many data curation efforts center on the quality of a dataset. However, most of these existing methods are (i) offline, i.e. they produce a static dataset from a set of predetermined filtering criteria, and (ii) concept-agnostic, i.e. they use model-based filters which induce additional data biases. In this work, we go beyond such offline, concept-agnostic methods and advocate for more flexible, task-adaptive online concept-based curation. Our first contribution is DataConcept, a collection of 128M web-crawled image-text pairs annotated with fine-grained details about their concept composition. Building on DataConcept, we introduce Concept-Aware Batch Sampling (CABS), a simple yet effective batch sampling framework that flexibly constructs batches on-the-fly based on specific target distributions. We propose two variants: (i) Diversity Maximization (CABS-DM) to curate batches with a broad coverage of available concepts, and (ii) Frequency Maximization (CABS-FM) to curate batches with high object multiplicity. Through extensive evaluations across 28 benchmarks, we demonstrate that our CABS method significantly benefits CLIP/SigLIP model classes and yields highly performant models. Overall, CABS represents a strong open-source alternative to proprietary online data curation algorithms, enabling practitioners to define custom concept distributions that optimize for specific downstream tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7b5b\u9009\u65b9\u6cd5DataConcept\u548c\u6982\u5ff5\u611f\u77e5\u6279\u91cf\u91c7\u6837\u6846\u67b6CABS\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u7ebf\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7b5b\u9009\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u7b5b\u9009\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4e3a\u79bb\u7ebf\u4e14\u6982\u5ff5\u65e0\u5173\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u6570\u636e\u504f\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u6982\u5ff5\u5316\u7b5b\u9009\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u6784\u5efaDataConcept\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff081.28\u4ebf\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\uff09\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u63d0\u51faCABS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6700\u5927\u5316\uff08CABS-DM\uff09\u548c\u9891\u7387\u6700\u5927\u5316\uff08CABS-FM\uff09\u4e24\u79cd\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\u52a8\u6001\u6784\u5efa\u8bad\u7ec3\u6279\u6b21\u3002", "result": "\u572828\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0cCABS\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86CLIP/SigLIP\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "CABS\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f7f\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u80fd\u591f\u5b9a\u4e49\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u6982\u5ff5\u5206\u5e03\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u7279\u5b9a\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

To address these limitations, we present VLM$^2$, a Vision-Language Model with persistent Memory for spatial reasoning with a view-consistent, 3D-aware representation purely from 2D video. Specifically, to enhance long-horizon reasoning, we incorporate a dual-memory module, consisting of a working memory that operates as a sliding window to focus on immediate context, and an episodic memory that consolidates and stores critical long-term information.

However, it relies on a two-stage pipeline where the pretrained autoencoder introduces lossy reconstruction, leading to error accumulation while hindering joint optimization. To address these issues, we propose PixelDiT, a single-stage, end-to-end model that eliminates the need for the autoencoder and learns the diffusion process directly in the pixel space. PixelDiT adopts a fully transformer-based architecture shaped by a dual-level design: a patch-level DiT that captures global semantics and a pixel-level DiT that refines texture details, enabling efficient training of a pixel-space diffusion model while preserving fine details. Our analysis reveals that effective pixel-level token modeling is essential to the success of pixel diffusion.

We tackle this challenge by formulating it as a set-level policy optimization problem, with the goal of training a policy that can cover the diverse range of plausible outcomes for a given prompt. To address this, we introduce DPP-GRPO, a novel framework for diverse video generation that combines Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) theories to enforce explicit reward on diverse generations. Our objective turns diversity into an explicit signal by imposing diminishing returns on redundant samples (via DPP) while supplies groupwise feedback over candidate sets (via GRPO). Our framework is plug-and-play and model-agnostic, and encourages diverse generations across visual appearance, camera motions, and scene structure without sacrificing prompt fidelity or perceptual quality. We implement our method on WAN and CogVideoX, and show that our method consistently improves video diversity on state-of-the-art benchmarks such as VBench, VideoScore, and human preference studies.

Today's vision-language models (VLMs) excel at open-ended 2D description and grounding, yet multi-object 3D detection remains largely missing from the VLM toolbox. We present LocateAnything3D, a VLM-native recipe that casts 3D detection as a next-token prediction problem. The key is a short, explicit Chain-of-Sight (CoS) sequence that mirrors how human reason from images: find an object in 2D, then infer its distance, size, and pose. The decoder first emits 2D detections as a visual chain-of-thought, then predicts 3D boxes under an easy-to-hard curriculum: across objects, a near-to-far order reduces early ambiguity and matches ego-centric utility; within each object, a center-from-camera, dimensions, and rotation factorization ranks information by stability and learnability. This VLM-native interface preserves open-vocabulary and visual-prompting capability without specialized heads. On the challenging Omni3D benchmark, our model achieves state-of-the-art results, with 49.89 AP_3D, surpassing the previous best by +15.51 absolute improvement even when the baseline is given ground-truth 2D boxes.

We introduce $\\infty$-RoPE, a unified inference-time framework that addresses all three limitations through three interconnected components: Block-Relativistic RoPE, KV Flush, and RoPE Cut. Block-Relativistic RoPE reformulates temporal encoding as a moving local reference frame, where each newly generated latent block is rotated relative to the base model's maximum frame horizon while earlier blocks are rotated backward to preserve relative temporal geometry. This relativistic formulation eliminates fixed temporal positions, enabling continuous video generation far beyond the base positional limits. To obtain fine-grained action control without re-encoding, KV Flush renews the KV cache by retaining only two latent frames, the global sink and the last generated latent frame, thereby ensuring immediate prompt responsiveness. Finally, RoPE Cut introduces controlled discontinuities in temporal RoPE coordinates, enabling multi-cut scene transitions within a single continuous rollout.

Open-vocabulary object detection (OVOD) addresses this limitation but remains underexplored in medical imaging due to dataset scarcity and weak text-image alignment. To bridge this gap, we introduce MedROV, the first Real-time Open Vocabulary detection model for medical imaging. To enable open-vocabulary learning, we curate a large-scale dataset, Omnis, with 600K detection samples across nine imaging modalities and introduce a pseudo-labeling strategy to handle missing annotations from multi-source datasets. Additionally, we enhance generalization by incorporating knowledge from a large pre-trained foundation model. By leveraging contrastive learning and cross-modal representations, MedROV effectively detects both known and novel structures. Experimental results demonstrate that MedROV outperforms the previous state-of-the-art foundation model for medical image detection with an average absolute improvement of 40 mAP50, and surpasses closed-set detectors by more than 3 mAP50, while running at 70 FPS, setting a new benchmark in medical detection.

A key challenge, however, lies in designing effective and interpretable rewards. Existing methods often rely on either composite metrics (e.g., CLIP, OCR, and realism scores) with fixed weights or a single scalar reward distilled from human preference models, which can limit interpretability and flexibility. We propose RubricRL, a simple and general framework for rubric-based reward design that offers greater interpretability, composability, and user control. Instead of using a black-box scalar signal, RubricRL dynamically constructs a structured rubric for each prompt--a decomposable checklist of fine-grained visual criteria such as object correctness, attribute accuracy, OCR fidelity, and realism--tailored to the input text. Each criterion is independently evaluated by a multimodal judge (e.g., o4-mini), and a prompt-adaptive weighting mechanism emphasizes the most relevant dimensions. This design not only produces interpretable and modular supervision signals for policy optimization (e.g., GRPO or PPO), but also enables users to directly adjust which aspects to reward or penalize. Experiments with an autoregressive text-to-image model demonstrate that RubricRL improves prompt faithfulness, visual detail, and generalizability, while offering a flexible and extensible foundation for interpretable RL alignment across text-to-image architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "RubricRL\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u51c6\u6e05\u5355\u6765\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fa\u5b9a\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u590d\u5408\u6307\u6807\u6216\u5355\u4e00\u6807\u91cf\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002\u9700\u8981\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u900f\u660e\u3001\u53ef\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u63d0\u793a\u52a8\u6001\u6784\u5efa\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5bf9\u8c61\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3001\u5c5e\u6027\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001OCR\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u7b49\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u51c6\u3002\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6807\u51c6\u7531\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u72ec\u7acb\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u63d0\u793a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u52a0\u6743\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eRubricRL\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u63d0\u793a\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u7ec6\u8282\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "conclusion": "RubricRL\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u67b6\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u9f50\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u7528\u6237\u63a7\u5236\u3002"}}

The aim of the present study was to develop a fully deep learning model to reduce the intra- and inter-operator reproducibility of sector classification systems for predicting unerupted maxillary canine likelihood of impaction. Methods. Three orthodontists (Os) and three general dental practitioners (GDPs) classified the position of unerupted maxillary canines on 306 radiographs (T0) according to the three different sector classification systems (5-, 4-, and 3-sector classification system). The assessment was repeated after four weeks (T1). Intra- and inter-observer agreement were evaluated with Cohen's K and Fleiss K, and between group differences with a z-test. The same radiographs were tested on different artificial intelligence (AI) models, pre-trained on an extended dataset of 1,222 radiographs. The best-performing model was identified based on its sensitivity and precision. Results. The 3-sector system was found to be the classification method with highest reproducibility, with an agreement (Cohen's K values) between observations (T0 versus T1) for each examiner ranged from 0.80 to 0.92, and an overall agreement of 0.85 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.83-0.87]. The overall inter-observer agreement (Fleiss K) ranged from 0.69 to 0.7. The educational background did not affect either intra- or inter-observer agreement (p>0.05). DenseNet121 proved to be the best-performing model in allocating impacted canines in the three different classes, with an overall accuracy of 76.8%. Conclusion.
